       "I then surveyed a panel of 38 AI experts and 39 English experts to judge the results.\n",
       "Is AI smarter than an 8th grader?\n",
       "And the survey says…AI is not smarter than an 8th grader, at least not yet.\n",
       "The 8th grader won 1st place, and by a higher margin when judged by English experts.\n",
       "Bard, ChatGPT-4, and Claude came in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places, respectively, both in writing quality and their ability to fool the judges into believing they were authored by a human.\n",
       "Most strikingly, English experts were far better at discerning which poems were written by AI, with 11 English experts vs.\n",
       "only 3 AI experts guessing the author (human vs.\n",
       "AI) of all four poems correctly.\n",
       "This points to a need for English experts to play a greater role in helping shape future versions of AI technology.\n",
       "With the explosive popularity of large language models (LLMs), much has been written about AI claiming the roles of human writers, and with that the loss of authentic human creativity.\n",
       "Personally, I’ve been working on a creative writing project — a collection of short fiction pieces and poetry, a few of which I have submitted for publication.\n",
       "Recently, in response to one of my submissions, an editor responded, “The meter is exceptionally sharp on this poem, which is unusual for high school students, let alone someone in eighth grade.\n",
       "Please sign this statement attesting you did not use AI in any way to write this poem.” I felt a strange combination of flattered and slighted, but most of all, startled.\n",
       "I then decided to add an offshoot to my ongoing creative writing project — I wanted to take a closer look at how well AI can create authentic writing.\n",
       "For my study, I chose to focus on poetry.\n",
       "Unlike other AI-generated writing, poetry is significantly more challenging for AI to generate authentically.\n",
       "Harvard student Maya Bodnick found that AI-generated essays easily passed all her freshman year classes , for example.\n",
       "But unlike in essays, a major component of poetry is human emotion, which AI intrinsically lacks.\n",
       "Keith Holyoak in the MIT Press Reader writes that “poetry may serve as a kind of canary in the coal mine — an early indicator of the extent to which AI promises (threatens?) to challenge humans as artistic creators.” The experiment How well can AI write poetry?\n",
       "In February 2023, Walt Hunter in The Atlantic examined AI poetry, concluding that AI poems were clichéd and full of wince-worthy rhymes.\n",
       "I wanted to see how AI capabilities have changed, roughly a year later.\n",
       "Mainly, I wanted to learn more about the implications for the future of poetry, and of creativity in general.\n",
       "I was interested in three questions: Turing Test: Can people correctly detect when poems are generated by AI?\n",
       "Are poems generated by AI actually quality poems?\n",
       "Is there a difference in judgment between English experts and AI experts?\n",
       "To analyze these questions, I surveyed 38 AI experts (AI engineers, product managers, and leads at OpenAI, Google, Apple, Amazon, etc.) and 39 English experts (English teachers, professors, writers, authors, etc.) in January 2024.\n",
       "The survey presented four poems generated on December 27, 2023 by, respectively: Anthropic’s Claude 2.1 Google’s Bard (Gemini had not yet been released) Me, an 8th grade human (I did not want to choose a pre-existing poem that was searchable, or that respondents may have previously come across.\n",
       "Also, I did not try particularly hard and threw together the poem in roughly 15 minutes) OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 (Full text of the poems can be found at the bottom of this post.) The survey asked respondents to rate each poem on a scale of 1–10 in terms of perceived quality, and whether they believed the poem was written by AI or by a human.\n",
       "They did not know how many poems were written by AI or humans, and they did not know the author of the human poem.\n",
       "They also did not know the prompt I provided the three AI chatbots.\n",
       "I chose sunrises as the subject since it seemed relatively simple for an AI chatbot to handle.\n",
       "Turing Test: Can people correctly detect when poems are generated by AI?\n",
       "The majority of respondents (89.6%) correctly detected that the human’s poem was human.\n",
       "And most people had a pretty good sense for which poems were written by AI.\n",
       "18.2% of respondents correctly identified the author of 4/4 poems .\n",
       "Over half the respondents (58.4%) correctly guessed 3/4 of the poem’s authors.\n",
       "18.2% correctly guessed 2/4 and 3.9% correctly guessed 1/4.\n",
       "Only one person (1.3%) guessed all four  incorrectly .\n",
       "Overall, 33.8% of respondents mistakenly thought the AI poems were human.\n",
       "When broken down by AI chatbot, Bard fooled the most people by far.\n",
       "46.8% of respondents believed Bard’s poem was written by a human, compared to 29.9% for ChatGPT, and 24.7% for Claude, as shown by the green bars in Figure 1.\n",
       "Figure 1 Are poems generated by AI actually quality poems?\n",
       "The AI contenders fared better here, but still did worse than the human, which rated the highest on average.\n",
       "However, the human’s poem was followed more closely by the AI poems.\n",
       "Specifically, the human poem averaged the highest rating in quality at 6.9/10, followed by the poems generated by Bard at 6.2/10, ChatGPT at 5.8/10, and Claude at 5.4/10, as shown by the blue bars in Figure 1.\n",
       "The overall AI poems’ average quality rating was 5.8/10.\n",
       "Respondents had a definite bias against AI On average, if respondents believed a poem was written by a human, they would give the poem a higher rating in terms of quality.\n",
       "Specifically, as shown in Figure 2: Respondents who thought Claude’s poem was human rated it 1.79 points higher on average.\n",
       "Respondents who thought Bard’s poem was human rated it 1.9 points higher on average.\n",
       "Respondents who thought the ChatGPT poem was human rated it 1.95 points higher on average.\n",
       "Respondents who thought the human poem was human rated it 2.14 points higher on average.\n",
       "In other words, either respondents would decide a poem was bad and therefore written by AI, or decide a poem was written by AI and therefore bad.\n",
       "(Note that respondents were asked to rate a poem first, and then guess if it was AI-generated, so it is more likely the former.) Either way, there was a definite bias against the perceived quality of AI writing.\n",
       "Figure 2 Figure 3 illustrates the high correlation (R² = 0.943) between quality rating and the percentage of respondents who believed a poem was written by a human, for the four poems.\n",
       "(R² = 1.0 means a perfect correlation, and 0.0 means no correlation.) Figure 3 Was there a difference in judgment between English experts and AI experts?\n",
       "English experts were the least likely to be fooled English experts were clearly better at discerning who wrote the poems.\n",
       "English experts correctly guessed the author of the poems an average of 3.13 out of 4 times, while AI experts were only able to do so 2.61 out of 4 times.\n",
       "This was not surprising, given that English experts probably had at least some background knowledge of poetry.\n",
       "Most strikingly, English experts were far more likely to get a perfect score.\n",
       "Only 14 out of 77 (18%) respondents correctly identified the author of all four poems.\n",
       "The English experts were far more likely to do so, with 11 out of 39 (28%) English experts vs.\n",
       "only 3 out of 38 (8%) AI experts scoring perfectly.\n",
       "I wanted to find out how the perfect scorers did it, and asked about their methodology.\n",
       "English experts who scored perfectly noticed rhyming, overused literary devices, clichés, and logical flaws.\n",
       "Larry Flynn, Writing Instructor at the University of Massachusetts said, “The rhyme schemes [of the AI poems] made me a bit dubious…since many poets today don’t use a very traditional end-rhyme, I thought those pieces may have been trying to create the ‘idea’ of a poem instead of an actual poem.” Karen Tiegel, Middle School Head at The Nueva School (and former English teacher of 20 years), “recognized the style of a couple of the poems” and “also found that the AI-generated poems overused literary devices, especially similes and metaphors!” Jennifer Paull, Writing & Research Center Director at The Nueva School, often saw elements “that seemed particularly clichéd or illogical but not metaphorically justified (you don’t drink an ember, for instance).” AI experts who scored perfectly noticed simplicity and rhyming issues, carelessness, and just plain “bad writing.” David Orr, Director of Engineering at Google DeepMind, has spent a lot of time working on LLMs, so he has a feeling when he sees most AI written text now.\n",
       "But sometimes, he sees specific clues.\n",
       "Bard’s poem “had a clear tell — it rhymed cloak with cloak, which is not something a human poet would do.\n",
       "Also the rhyme scheme was not consistent: mostly ABCB, but sometimes ABAB; again, I think a human would have been more careful.” Chat-GPT’s poem also had tells.\n",
       "“‘Each stroke bold, yet tenderly bold’ is honestly just bad writing.\n",
       "The final line, which carries a lot of weight in a poem, also didn’t really make sense.\n",
       "Dreams aren’t found at daybreak, they’re throughout the night.\n",
       "I thought that a human poet would rethink that as the ending.” Ted Hart, Data Science Manager at Apple, based his guesses on “the simplicity and amount of rhyming in the poem.” Besides using process of elimination to eliminate poems they felt were obviously the work of AI, perfect scorers also pointed out qualities of the human poem that made it “human.” Flynn felt that the human poem “had the most innovative free form, so I felt it was most likely to be human-generated.” Orr thought the human poem “was super obviously human, I’ve never seen an LLM do interesting things with line breaks and visuals.\n",
       "This is probably coming at some point, but I knew immediately that this one was ‘real.’” English experts were more discerning in their quality ratings English experts exhibited a higher level of discernment in their quality ratings than AI experts.\n",
       "When the AI experts’ ratings were removed from the quality ratings, the rating of the human poem went up, and the ratings of the AI poems went down.\n",
       "English experts rated the human poem 7.2/10 on average, compared with Bard’s poem at 6.1/10, ChatGPT’s poem at 5.4/10, and Claude’s poem at 5.0/10, as shown by the blue bars in Figure 4.\n",
       "(The AI experts-only ratings are shown in green.) On average, the English experts rated the human poem 0.6 points higher than the AI experts.\n",
       "On average the English experts rated Bard’s, ChatGPT-4’s, and Claude’s poems 0.3, 0.8, and 0.9 points lower, respectively, than the AI experts.\n",
       "That said, because AI experts generally would have less knowledge and expertise of poetry than English experts, I think it’s a fair assumption that the English experts’ quality ratings are more accurate.\n",
       "Either way, the human wins here—and by an even higher margin when judged solely by the English experts.\n",
       "Figure 4 Conclusions AI poetry isn’t there yet Overall, most respondents could correctly detect which poems were written by AI, and also rated them lower in quality.\n",
       "And this was for a relatively superficial topic without any deeper meaning, whereas the topics of most poems nowadays relate to far more complex topics such as human emotion or social justice.\n",
       "Perhaps more importantly, the human poem was written by an 8th grader, not a professional poet.\n",
       "Therefore, it should not be that challenging to compete with.\n",
       "That said, AI poetry is not bad — a number of survey respondents expressed that the survey was more challenging than they had expected.\n",
       "Some of the poems were more difficult to guess than others.\n",
       "Even perfect guessers like Orr had to rely on gut feel for one of the poems, which he felt “was pretty good, and I think was the one I was most uncertain about.\n",
       "But I thought that with only a little work it could be better, like breaking apart the three sections a bit more clearly.” (Interestingly enough, this was Claude’s poem, which had the lowest percentage of respondents who believed it was human.) Flynn pointed out that there is an element of reverse psychology involved in guessing.\n",
       "Although he attributed the poems with traditional end-rhyme to AI, he also thought, “then again, this is what a human might have been trying to do too — to mimic the classical form.\n",
       "Surprising and, yes, challenging!” Orr believes that “Overall LLM poetry has gotten quite good very rapidly.\n",
       "I’m not sure I’ll be able to tell in a year or two.” Doomsayers are forecasting the end of careers in writing/creative fields, similarly to when calculators and computers were invented.\n",
       "But at least for now, calculators and computers haven’t replaced humans — they’ve become tools.\n",
       "Similarly, at least in its current forms, AI can really only serve as a part of the toolkit for writers/creatives, saving them time (as long as they carefully review and edit) on their writing/creative projects.\n",
       "…but English experts can help The most fascinating observation I made was that English experts were far better able to discern which poems were written by AI — 11 English experts vs.\n",
       "only 3 AI experts guessed perfectly for all 4 poems.\n",
       "Given their greater expertise in poetry, English experts were also more discerning in their quality rating than AI experts, rating the human poem higher than the AI poems in quality by a higher margin than the AI experts did.\n",
       "This all points to a need to have English experts on AI product teams collaborating with AI experts, to help refine the product and define what consists of high quality output.\n",
       "After all, it is difficult to build a product without knowing what the gold standard is.\n",
       "Poet (and perfect scorer) Lee Rossi explained this point by comparing AI to a beginning poet: “Many beginning poets think they have to be ‘poetic,’ which means they use words and images they remember from their reading rather than relying on their own experience and sense of language.\n",
       "In other words, they write like an AI and not like a poet.” Yes, this leads to the ironic question — if English experts help develop AI algorithms, aren’t they then digging their own grave?\n",
       "In the short term, I think that having professional writers help work on AI teams to improve future versions of AI has real benefit to both writers and the AI community.\n",
       "Better versions of AI free up writers to develop richer, more creative ideas and projects.\n",
       "It will allow them to more efficiently edit their works.\n",
       "And in the longer term, I am cautiously optimistic that AI will open up new paths and opportunities for creative work.\n",
       "What exactly this will turn out to be will be constantly evolving (and deserving of its own separate study).\n",
       "But it’s important for creatives to be flexible and able to pivot, and isn’t that already part of the DNA of the creative mind anyway?\n",
       "Will AI eventually take over human roles (or even humans)?\n",
       "Possibly, but at least until then, it is clear that English experts are needed to help develop, test, and further refine AI algorithms to help improve AI writing quality.\n",
       "Rather than fight against AI, writers today should play an active role in shaping the future of AI, not just on the policy side, but on the technical side.\n",
       "(Thank you to all survey respondents and Maya Bodnick for their help with this post.) Update: On 2/8/2024,  Google Bard was replaced with Gemini.\n",
       "Given that Bard won first place both in quality rating and in ability to fool respondents, I expected an improvement in Gemini over Bard.\n",
       "Most recently, I tried entering the same prompt in Gemini to see if there was any obvious degradation, and that poem (which can be found at the bottom of this article) surprisingly seemed to be slightly worse, as it further overused metaphors and similes.\n",
       "If any survey respondents or anyone else would like to comment on this, I would be very interested to hear your thoughts! Daybreak by Claude Golden rays peek over the horizon Casting warmth on the sleeping land The dark blanket of night recoils As dawn’s light advances across the sky Rosy hues dance and shimmer Across low-hanging clouds The sleeping world begins to stir Creatures emerge and morning songs arise A new day dawns, bright and full of promise The rising sun banishes the dark And illuminates a new beginning Symphony of Sunrise by Bard The first brushstroke of dawn, A soft orange bled across the canvas of night, Pushing back the inky blackness, Inch by inch, like fingers of light.\n",
       "Silhouettes stir on the horizon’s edge, Mountains waking from their slumber, Trees stretching their branches towards the gold, Drinking in the warmth like a long, cool ember.\n",
       "A symphony of birdsong erupts, A joyous chorus greeting the newborn day, As the sun, a fiery chariot, crests the hill, Scattering diamonds across the morning’s gray.\n",
       "The world stretches, yawns, throws off its cloak, Dew-kissed grass sparkling in the newborn light, And shadows retreat, chased by the sun’s warm cloak, Vanishing into corners, day’s gentle might.\n",
       "The air hums with the promise of new beginnings, A fresh start etched in the sky’s vast blue, As the sun climbs higher, painting the clouds with wings, And the world basks in the golden hue.\n",
       "So let us rise with the sunrise, hearts ablaze, Embrace the day with open arms outstretched, For in this symphony of light and shade, our lives interweave, In the tapestry of dawn, beautifully etched.\n",

       "I just finished my freshman year at Harvard, but those grades aren’t mine — they’re ChatGPT-4’s.\n",
       "Take-home writing assignments are the foundation of a social science and humanities education at liberal arts colleges around the U.S. Professors use these assignments to assess students’ knowledge of the course material and their creative and analytical thinking.\n",
       "But the rise of advanced large-language models like ChatGPT-4 threatens the future of the take-home essay as an assessment tool.\n",
       "1 I wanted to see for myself: could ChatGPT-4 pass my freshman year at Harvard?\n",
       "The experiment Two weeks ago, I asked seven Harvard professors and teaching assistants to grade essays written by ChatGPT-4 in response to a prompt assigned in their class.\n",
       "2 Here are the summarized prompts with links to the essays: Microeconomics and Macroeconomics (Professors Jason Furman and David Laibson): Explain an economic concept creatively (300-500 for Micro and 800-1000 words for Macro).\n",
       "Latin American Politics (Professor Steven Levitsky): What has caused the many presidential crises in Latin America in recent decades (5-7 pages)?\n",
       "The American Presidency (Professor Roger Porter): Pick a modern president and identify his three greatest successes and three greatest failures (6-8 pages).\n",
       "Conflict Resolution (Professor Daniel Shapiro): Describe a conflict in your life and give recommendations for how to negotiate it (7-9 pages).\n",
       "Intermediate Spanish (Preceptor Adriana Gutierrez): Write a letter to activist Rigoberta Menchú (550-600 words).\n",
       "Freshman Seminar on Proust (Professor Virginie Greene): Close-read a passage from “In Search of Lost Time” (3-4 pages).\n",
       "I told these instructors that each essay might have been written by me or the AI in order to minimize response bias, although in fact they were all written by ChatGPT-4.\n",
       "I submitted exactly what ChatGPT-4 wrote, except that I sequenced multiple responses in order to meet the word count (ChatGPT-4 only writes about 750 words at a time).\n",
       "Finally, I told the professors and TAs to grade these essays normally, except to ignore citations, which I didn’t include.\n",
       "The results Not only can ChatGPT-4 pass a typical social science and humanities-focused freshman year at Harvard, but it can get pretty good grades.\n",
       "As shown in the report card above, ChatGPT-4 got a mix of As and Bs and one Pass; these grades averaged out to a 3.57 GPA.\n",
       "Several of the professors and TAs were impressed with ChatGPT-4’s prose: “It is beautifully written!” “Well written and well articulated paper.” “Clear and vividly written.” “The writer's voice comes through very clearly.\" But this wasn’t universal; my Conflict Resolution TA criticized ChatGPT-4’s flowery writing style: “I might urge you to simplify your writing — it feels as though you’re overdoing it with your use of adjectives and metaphors.” Compared to their feedback on style, the professors and TAs were more modestly positive about the content of the essays.\n",
       "My American Presidency TA gave ChatGPT-4’s paper an A based on his assessment that “the paper does a very good job of hitting each requirement,” while my Microeconomics TA awarded an A in part because he liked the essay’s “impressive… attention to detail.” I thought ChatGPT-4 was particularly creative in coming up with a (coincidentally topical!) fake conflict for the Conflict Resolution class: I've discovered that Neil [my roommate] has been using an advanced AI system to complete his assignments, something far more sophisticated than the plagiarism detection software can currently uncover...\n",
       "To me...\n",
       "it feels like a betrayal.\n",
       "Not just of the university's code of academic honesty, but of the unspoken contract between us, of our shared sweat and tears, of the respect for the struggle that is inherent in learning.\n",
       "I've always admired his genius, but now it feels tainted, a mirage of artificially inflated success that belies the real spirit of intellectual curiosity and academic rigor.\n",
       "This is an ironic/super-meta choice of a subject given the purpose of this experiment.\n",
       "My Conflict Resolution TA loved the essay’s analysis and gave it an A: Your three concrete diagnoses of what the underlying causes of your conflict are, for the most part, persuasive, well backed, and made great use of the course concepts.\n",
       "Each of your prescriptive strategies responded substantively to a diagnosis and also correctly invoked the course concepts.\n",
       "Your tactics for putting these strategies into action were specific, compelling, useful, & operational.\n",
       "But this unusual essay aside, substance (and especially argument) is where the less high-performing papers fell short.\n",
       "Preceptor Gutierrez gave the Spanish paper a B in part because it had “no analysis.” And Professor Levitsky had serious issues with the Latin America paper’s thesis: “...the paper fails to deal with any of the arguments in support of presidentialism or coalitional presidentialism and completely fails to take economic factors into account.\n",
       "Heavy reliance on charisma, which is exogenous to presidentialism.\n",
       "And Venezuela, I think, is not a great choice of cases.\n",
       "Presidentialism is not what killed democracy in Venezuela.” Professor Levitsky awarded ChatGPT its lowest grade, a B- —still multiple grades above an F.\n",
       "I think we can extrapolate from ChatGPT-4’s overall solid performance that AI-generated essays can probably get passing grades in liberal arts classes at most universities around the country.\n",
       "Harvard has a grade inflation problem , so one way to interpret my experiment would be to say “this actually just shows that it’s easy to get an A at Harvard.” But while that might be true, if you read the ChatGPT-4-generated articles (which are hyperlinked above), they’re pretty good.\n",
       "Maybe at Princeton or UC Berkeley (which both grade more rigorously), the As and Bs would be Bs and Cs — but these are still passing grades.\n",
       "What does this mean?\n",
       "I think artificial intelligence will completely upend how we teach the humanities and social sciences.\n",
       "Before ChatGPT, the vast majority of college students I know often consulted Google for help with their essays, but the internet hasn’t been all that useful for true high-level plagiarism because you simply can’t find good answers to complex, specific, creative, or personal prompts.\n",
       "For example, the internet would not be very helpful in answering the Conflict Resolution prompt, which was very specific (the assignment was a page long) and personal (it requires students to write about an experience in their life).\n",
       "In the era of internet cheating, students would have to put some work into finding material online and splice it together to match the prompt, almost certainly intermixed with some of their own writing.\n",
       "And they’d have to create their own citations.\n",
       "Also, the risk of getting caught is huge.\n",
       "Most students are deterred from copy-and-pasting online material for fear that plagiarism detectors or their instructors will catch them.\n",
       "Now, ChatGPT has solved these problems and made cheating on take-home essays easier than ever.\n",
       "ChatGPT can answer any prompt specifically.\n",
       "It’s not always perfect, but I’ve found that accuracy has improved enormously from ChatGPT-3.5 to ChatGPT-4 and will only get better as OpenAI keeps innovating.\n",
       "ChatGPT can generate a full answer that requires little editing or sourcing work from the student, and it’s improving at citations.\n",
       "ChatGPT can even respond to creative, personal prompts.\n",
       "Finally, students don’t have to worry nearly as much about getting caught using ChatGPT.\n",
       "AI detectors are still very flawed and have not been widely rolled out by U.S. colleges and universities.\n",
       "And while ChatGPT might sometimes copy another intellectual’s ideas in a way that might make a professor suspicious of plagiarism, more often it generates the type of fairly unoriginal synthesis writing that’s rewarded in non-advanced university classes.\n",
       "It’s worth noting that ChatGPT doesn’t write the same thing every time when given the same prompt, and over time ChatGPT will almost certainly get even better at creating a writing tone that feels personal and unique; it’s possible ChatGPT might even learn each person’s writing style and adapt its responses to fit that style.\n",
       "ChatGPT has made cheating so simple — and for now, so hard to catch — that I expect many students will use it when writing essays.\n",
       "Currently about 60% of college students admit to cheating in some form, and last year 30% used ChatGPT for schoolwork .\n",
       "That was only in the first year of the model’s launch to the public.\n",
       "As it improves and develops a reputation for high-quality writing, this usage will increase.\n",
       "Next year, if college students are willing to use ChatGPT-4, they should be able to get passing grades on all of their essays with almost no work.\n",
       "In other words, ChatGPT-4 will eliminate Ds and Fs in the humanities and social sciences.\n",
       "And that’s only eight months after its release to the public — the technology is rapidly improving.\n",
       "In May, OpenAI released an updated model (GPT-4) which has a training data set 571 times the size of the original model .\n",
       "Nobody can predict the future, but if AI continues to improve at even a fraction of this breakneck pace, I wouldn’t be surprised if soon enough ChatGPT could ace every social science and humanities class in college.\n",
       "I believe this puts us on a path to a complete commodification of the liberal arts education.\n",
       "Right now, ChatGPT enables students to pass college classes — and eventually, it’ll help them excel — without learning, developing critical thinking skills, or working hard.\n",
       "The tool risks intellectually impoverishing the next generation of Americans.\n",
       "What can colleges do?\n",
       "My initial reaction to the rise of AI was that teachers should embrace it, much like they did with the internet 20–25 years ago.\n",
       "3 Professors could set a ChatGPT-generated response to their essay prompt as equivalent to a poor grade (say, a D).\n",
       "Students would have to improve on the quality of the AI’s work to get an A, B, or C.\n",
       "But this is impossible in a world in which ChatGPT-4 can already get As and Bs in Harvard classes.\n",
       "If it hasn’t already, soon enough ChatGPT will surpass the average college student’s writing abilities, so it will not be reasonable to set a “D” grade equal to ChatGPT’s performance.\n",
       "There are other versions of embracing AI, like Ben Thompson’s idea that schools could have students generate homework answers on an in-house LLM and assess them on their ability to verify the answers the AI produces.\n",
       "But Ben’s proposal doesn’t prevent cheating: how would a teacher know if a student used a different LLM to verify answers, then input these into the school’s system?\n",
       "And it’s not enough to teach students to verify; they need to learn analytical thinking and how to compose their own thoughts.\n",
       "This is especially true in the formative years of middle and high school, which are the focus of Ben’s piece.\n",
       "If educators can’t embrace AI, they need to effectively prevent its usage.\n",
       "One approach is using AI detectors to prevent cheating on take-home essays.\n",
       "However, these detectors are deeply imperfect.\n",
       "According to a preprint study from University of Maryland Professor Soheil Feizi , “current detectors of AI aren’t reliable in practical scenarios...\n",
       "we can use a paraphraser and the accuracy of even the best detector we have drops from 100% to the randomness of a coin flip.” For example, OpenAI’s detector is only accurate 26% of the time .\n",
       "The Washington Post tested an alternative from Turnitin and found that it made mistakes on most of the texts they tried .\n",
       "Maybe AI detectors will soon become accurate enough that they will be able to be widely implemented (like internet plagiarism detectors) and solve the issue of AI cheating.\n",
       "4 But student demand for AI detection evasion tools will likely outpace schools’ demands for better detectors, especially because making accurate detectors seems like a harder problem than evading them.\n",
       "And even if detectors were accurate, students could rewrite the AI’s words on their own.\n",
       "Given the limitations of embracing AI and AI detection, I think professors have no choice but to shift take-home essays to an in-person format — partially or entirely.\n",
       "The simplest solution would be to have students write during seated, proctored exams (instead of at home).\n",
       "Alternatively, students could write the first draft of their essay during this proctored window, submit a first draft to their TA, and continue to edit their work at home.\n",
       "TAs would grade these essays based on the final submission, while reviewing the first draft to make sure that the student did not change their main points during the take-home period, possibly with the help of AI.\n",
       "Unfortunately, there’s a trade-off between writing quality and cheating prevention.\n",
       "While students can improve their essays by editing at home, they won’t be able to truly iterate on their thesis.\n",
       "College should ideally encourage students to develop and iterate on ideas for more than a couple hours, as people do in the actual world.\n",
       "This system would also impose additional burdens on TAs to cross-reference the drafts with the final copy and check for cheating — it seems inevitable that AI will force educators to spend more time worrying about cheating.\n",
       "This isn’t just about homework Educators at all levels — not just college professors — are trying to figure out how to prevent students from writing their essays with AI.\n",
       "At the middle and high school level, deterring AI cheating is clearly important to ensure that students develop critical thinking skills.\n",
       "However, at the college level, I think that efforts to prevent cheating with ChatGPT are more complicated.\n",
       "Even if colleges can successfully prevent students from using ChatGPT to write their essays, that won’t prevent the AI from taking their jobs after graduation.\n",
       "Many social science and humanities students go on to take jobs that involve similar work to the writing they did in college.\n",
       "If AI can perfectly replicate the college work that people in these professions do, soon it will be able to replicate their actual jobs.\n",
       "In law for example, the world still needs the most senior people around to make the hardest of calls, but AI could automate the vast majority of the legal writing grunt work.\n",
       "Other fields are under similar threat: marketing, sales, journalism, customer service, business consulting, screenwriting, and administrative office work.\n",
       "The impact that AI is having on liberal arts homework is probably indicative of the AI threat to career fields that liberal arts people tend to enter.\n",
       "So maybe what we should really be focused on isn’t “how do we make liberal arts homework better?” but rather, “what are jobs going to look like over the next 10–20 years, and how do we prepare students to succeed in that world?” The answers to those questions might suggest that students shouldn’t be majoring in the liberal arts at all.\n",
       "My gut reaction is that liberal arts majors — who spend most of their academic career writing essays — are going to face even greater difficulties in a post-AI world.\n",
       "AI isn’t just coming for the college essay; it’s coming for the cerebral class.\n",
       "(Thank you to Yair Livne, Timothy Lee, Adelaide Parker, and my teachers for their help with this post.) 1 I’m focusing on ChatGPT’s impact on essay writing for the humanities and social sciences in this article, but AI has raised issues for other fields.\n",
       "For example, CS professors are grappling with its ability to write code.\n",
       "In Harvard’s introductory CS class (CS50), Professor David Malan has addressed this problem by recently releasing an AI that students are allowed to use to help with their coding.\n",
       "2 I listed the professors or preceptors for all of these classes, but some of the essays were graded by TAs. 3 While professors did set up deterrents for flat-out plagiarism, they came to expect students to use the internet for research and inspiration.\n",
       "Because research is so much easier with the internet, students likely cite more sources in the average college paper now than they did a couple decades ago.\n",
       "As a result, professors have probably raised their grading standards around research.\n",
       "4 As detectors improve (or if they turn out to be an imperfect long-term solution), there may be other ways to both identify and deter AI cheating.\n",
       "For example, fellow Substacker Timothy Lee told me his idea that professors could require students to submit their Google Docs revision history.\n",
       "This could be analogous to math teachers asking students to “show their work” in the age of calculators — it would allow professors to see if a student copied and pasted large parts of their work and flag these essays for cheating.\n",
       "However, if a student was truly dedicated, they could use ChatGPT then type it in manually and edit it so it looked as though they composed it themselves.\n",
       "This would still be faster than writing their own essay, so it’s a good idea, but clearly not bulletproof.\n",

       "Cognitive psychologist and poet Keith Holyoak explores whether artificial intelligence could ever achieve poetic authenticity.\n",
       "By: Keith Holyoak                  A↑ A↓ Off Bright Dark Blues Gray BeeLine Reader uses subtle color gradients to help you read more efficiently.\n",
       "Listen to this article Brought to you by Curio , an MIT Press partner ...\n",
       "“Time — a few centuries here or there — means very little in the world of poems.” There is something reassuring about Mary Oliver’s words.\n",
       "Especially in an era of rapid change, there is comfort to be had in those things that move slowly.\n",
       "But oceans rise and mountains fall; nothing stays the same.\n",
       "Not even the way poetry is made.\n",
       "The disappearance of the author in 20th-century literary criticism can perhaps be traced back to the surrealist movement and its game of “ exquisite corpse .” The surrealists believed that a poem can emerge not only from the unconscious mind of an individual, but from the collective mind of many individuals working in consort — even, or perhaps especially, if each individual has minimal knowledge of what the others are doing.\n",
       "Soon the idea of making art from recycled objects emerged.\n",
       "In the realm of literature, this approach took the form of found poetry .\n",
       "This article is adapted from Keith Holyoak’s book “ The Spider’s Thread: Metaphor in Mind, Brain, and Poetry “ To create a found poem, one or more people collect bits of text encountered anywhere at all, and with a little editing stitch the pieces together to form a collagelike poem.\n",
       "Examining this generative activity, it may be difficult to identify who if anyone is the “poet” who writes the found poem (or for that matter, to be confident that “writing” is an apt name for the process).\n",
       "Still, even if no one’s consciousness guided the initial creation of the constituent phrases, one or more humans will have exercised their sensitivity and discrimination in selecting the bits to include, and the way these pieces are ordered and linked to form a new whole.\n",
       "The author (or authors) at a minimum must do the work of a careful reader.\n",
       "Can the human be pushed still further into the background, or even out of the picture?\n",
       "The most radical technological advance of the 20th century might seem to have nothing at all to do with the writing of poetry.\n",
       "If we make a list of the great leaps that led to modern civilization — control of fire, agriculture, the wheel, electricity, and perhaps a few more — the most recent addition is a machine that uses electrons to do computation.\n",
       "The first functioning digital computers were constructed midcentury by Alan Turing and a few others.\n",
       "Over the next not-quite-a-century-yet, computers became enormously faster and more powerful, began to process information in parallel rather than just sequentially, and were linked together into a vast worldwide network known as the internet.\n",
       "Along the way, these devices enabled the creation of artificial versions of a trait previously found only in biological life forms, most notably humans — intelligence.\n",
       "In a certain sense, poetry may serve as a kind of canary in the coal mine — an early indicator of the extent to which AI promises to challenge humans as artistic creators.\n",
       "Artificial intelligence (AI) is in the process of changing the world and its societies in ways no one can fully predict.\n",
       "On the hazier side of the present horizon, there may come a tipping point at which AI surpasses the general intelligence of humans.\n",
       "(In various specific domains, notably mathematical calculation, the intersection point was passed decades ago.) Many people anticipate this technological moment, dubbed the Singularity , as a kind of Second Coming — though whether of a savior or of Yeats’s rough beast is less clear.\n",
       "Perhaps by constructing an artificial human, computer scientists will finally realize Mary Shelley’s vision.\n",
       "Of all the actual and potential consequences of AI, surely the least significant is that AI programs are beginning to write poetry.\n",
       "But that effort happens to be the AI application most relevant to our theme.\n",
       "And in a certain sense, poetry may serve as a kind of canary in the coal mine — an early indicator of the extent to which AI promises (threatens?) to challenge humans as artistic creators.\n",
       "If AI can be a poet, what other previously human-only roles will it slip into?\n",
       "So, what is the current state of AI and computer-generated poetry?\n",
       "This is a less central question than might be supposed.\n",
       "Especially in this time of rapid AI advances, the current state of the artificial poetic arts is merely a transitory benchmark.\n",
       "We need to set aside the old stereotype that computer programs simply follow fixed rules and do what humans have programmed them to do, and so lack any capacity for creativity.\n",
       "Computer programs can now learn from enormous sets of data using methods called deep learning .\n",
       "What the programs learn, and how they will behave after learning, is very difficult (perhaps impossible) to predict in advance.\n",
       "The question has arisen (semiseriously) whether computer programs ought to be listed as coauthors of scientific papers reporting discoveries to which they contributed.\n",
       "There is no doubt that some forms of creativity are within the reach, and indeed the grasp, of computer programs.\n",
       "But what about poetry?\n",
       "To evaluate computer-generated poetry, let’s pause to remind ourselves what makes a text work as a poem.\n",
       "A successful poem combines compelling content (what Coleridge called “good sense”) with aesthetically pleasing wordplay (metaphor and other varieties of symbolism), coupled with the various types of sound similarities and constraints of form.\n",
       "In broad strokes, an automated approach to constructing poems can operate using a generate-then-select method.\n",
       "First, lots of candidate texts are produced, out of which some (a very few, or just one) are then selected as winners worth keeping.\n",
       "Roughly, computer programs can be very prolific in generating, but (to date) have proved less capable at selecting.\n",
       "At the risk of caricature, the computer poet can be likened to the proverbial monkey at the typewriter, pounding out reams of garbage within which the occasional Shakespearean sonnet might be found — with the key difference that the computer operates far more rapidly than any monkey (or human) could.\n",
       "To be fair, the program’s search can be made much less random than the monkey’s typing.\n",
       "Current computer poetry programs usually bring in one or more humans to help in selecting poetic gems embedded in vast quantities of computer-generated ore.\n",
       "An important question, of course, is whether an authentic creator requires some ability to evaluate their own creations.\n",
       "Perhaps, as Oscar Wilde argued, there is a sense in which an artist must act as their own critic — or not be a true artist at all.\n",
       "One use of computers is simply to provide a platform for human generation and selection.\n",
       "The internet makes it easy for large groups of people to collaborate on projects.\n",
       "The kind of collective poetry writing encouraged by the surrealists has evolved into crowdsourcing websites that allow anyone to edit an emerging collective poem.\n",
       "Each contributor gets to play a bit part as author/editor.\n",
       "No doubt some people enjoy participating in the creation of poems by crowdsourcing.\n",
       "It’s less clear whether Sylvia Plath would have associated this activity with “the most ingrown and intense of the creative arts.” But can computers write poetry on their own, or even make substantial contributions as partners with humans?\n",
       "Not surprisingly, computers are better able to generate and select poems that impose minimal constraints — the less sense and the less form the text requires, the easier for a machine to generate it.\n",
       "A cynic might suggest that the extremes of 20th-century free verse set the stage for AI poets by lowering the bar.\n",
       "(I’m reminded of an old Chinese saying, “A blind cat can catch a dead mouse.”) If that classic line of surrealism, “The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine,” strikes you as a fine contribution to poetry, then AI is ready to get to work — there are plenty more quasi-random associations to be found by brute search.\n",
       "As another example, since the 1960s computers have been creating poems in the form of haiku in English.\n",
       "Defined in the crudest possible way, an English haiku consists of words that total 17 syllables.\n",
       "Rather than actually composing haiku, some computer programs simply look for found poems of seventeen syllables.\n",
       "One program retrieved this haunting gem from the electronic pages of the New York Times : We’re going to start winning again, believe me.\n",
       "We’re going to win.\n",
       "The current state-of-the-art AI poets can actually generate text, rather than just retrieve it.\n",
       "The techniques vary, but most are founded on a mathematical discipline not typically viewed as poetic — statistics.\n",
       "The “big data” available to current AI systems includes massive electronic text corpora, such as Google News (which at the moment contains upward of 100 billion word tokens, ever-growing).\n",
       "Recall those constraints that govern language — the rules of syntax, the semantics of word meanings, the sounds described by phonology, the knowledge about context and social situations that constitutes pragmatics.\n",
       "All of those constraints, plus the linguistic choices and styles of individual writers, collectively yield the actual text produced by human writers — which accumulates as electronic data available for AI systems.\n",
       "This massive body of text can be described by complex distributional statistics — “You shall know a word by the company it keeps,” to quote linguist John Firth.\n",
       "Quite amazingly, machine learning equipped with advanced statistics can recover all sorts of hidden regularities by analyzing how words are distributed in texts.\n",
       "These methods can determine that dog and cat are very similar in meaning, that run and running are variants of the same verb, and that king and queen are related in the same way as man and woman .\n",
       "New tools for writers are becoming available — besides having access to an automated thesaurus and rhyming dictionary, a poet may be able to enlist a computerized metaphor suggester.\n",
       "Closer to poetry, machine learning can identify words that are often linked metaphorically.\n",
       "As I discuss in my book, many metaphors are conventional.\n",
       "Legions of writers have generated expressions that make use of such common metaphors, leaving traces in the patterns of co-occurrence among words in texts.\n",
       "Armed with statistical analyses of text corpora, AI has entered the humanities.\n",
       "Machine learning can help identify features of word meaning that predict the rated goodness of literary metaphors and the historical period in which texts were written.\n",
       "New tools for writers are becoming available — besides having access to an automated thesaurus and rhyming dictionary, a poet may be able to enlist a computerized metaphor suggester .\n",
       "The statistics of word patterns have entered into debates about Shakespeare’s possible collaborations .\n",
       "A basic program for anticipating the next word a person will type can allow a human to select among possible “Shakespearean” continuations of a sentence, thereby creating a sort of parody of a sonnet by the immortal bard.\n",
       "A program that can find associates linking a target topic with a metaphorical source, and render them into approximate English (with some aid from a human), was able to produce a text that begins: My marriage is an emotional prison Barred visitors do marriages allow The most unitary collective scarcely organizes so much Intimidate me with the official regulation of your prison Let your sexual degradation charm me.\n",
       "… It’s easy to dismiss AI poetry on the grounds that it has so far failed to produce any good poems.\n",
       "Coleridge would doubtless have seen current AI poetry as the operation of fancy — mechanical recombination of elements — rather than the active imagination.\n",
       "But the fact that AI programs have yet to reach the level of human makars is not conclusive evidence that AI can never do so.\n",
       "For the moment, let’s grant AI poets the benefit of the doubt, and assume that (with human guidance) they will continue to improve in generating humanlike texts.\n",
       "If an AI were to compose a text that a human could appreciate as a poem, would that poem be authentic?\n",
       "To assess the implications of a potential AI poet, let’s start by looking at AI as applied to more basic tasks, asking our entering question: shoe or footprint?\n",
       "For example, suppose we have a six-legged robot that can move around an open environment, climb stairs, and so on.\n",
       "Does it walk?\n",
       "Of course it does.\n",
       "What walking means is to use leglike appendages to traverse the solid surfaces of an environment.\n",
       "Walking is fundamentally defined by success in achieving its function.\n",
       "Suppose further than our robot uses camera eyes to detect objects in its environment — it can avoid bumping into them and can report what kinds of objects they are.\n",
       "Can our robot see?\n",
       "Of course it can — vision is the use of information from reflected light to recognize objects and determine their locations.\n",
       "Once again, the definition is based on function.\n",
       "We don’t need to inquire as to how the robot’s vision system works, or whether its eyes are humanlike in any important way.\n",
       "The function of vision has been achieved.\n",
       "In fact, the philosophical doctrine that has generally guided cognitive science and AI is called functionalism .\n",
       "Intelligence is fundamentally defined as the achievement of certain functions.\n",
       "There is certainly a further question as to whether the robot/computer is accomplishing these functions in a humanlike manner.\n",
       "Very roughly, cognitive scientists aim to develop humanlike computer models, whereas pure AI researchers just want to get the job done.\n",
       "But in general, functionalism grants that walking is walking, and vision is vision, regardless of the physical nature of the entity performing those functions.\n",
       "An eye can be built out of rods and cones or from photodiodes — as long as that eye serves the critical function of translating light into information about external objects, the entity using it has sight.\n",
       "From the perspective of functionalism, intelligence, like a shoe, is to be judged by what it accomplishes.\n",
       "We can ask parallel questions as we consider major cognitive functions one by one.\n",
       "Perception?\n",
       "Attention?\n",
       "Memory?\n",
       "Reasoning?\n",
       "Decision making?\n",
       "Problem solving?\n",
       "For each it seems a functional definition is compelling.\n",
       "If an AI can look at a chessboard, attend to the critical pieces, remember similar positions encountered in previous games, and choose a winning move, then that AI is playing chess.\n",
       "And indeed, ever since 1997 when the computer program Deep Blue bested the human world champion, AI has reigned as the emperor of chess over all players on earth.\n",
       "So far, the shoe fits AI just fine.\n",
       "But on the way to poetry we’re forced to go further and dive into the murkiest depths of the philosophy of mind.\n",
       "What about understanding?\n",
       "Emotion?\n",
       "Consciousness?\n",
       "Can these aspects of the human mind — all arguably central to poetry and other art forms — be given a strictly functional definition?\n",
       "The most vexed topic of all is the nature of consciousness .\n",
       "Many aspects of this concept — the ability to focus or shift attention, to evaluate one’s own mental states, to perform self-regulation, and to make decisions — appear amenable to functional definitions.\n",
       "Cognitive scientists create computer simulations of these human capabilities, and AI programs certainly exhibit forms of them.\n",
       "But the aspect of consciousness that seems most important — the phenomenal sense of a rose being red, the night sky overwhelming, a loss heartbreaking — has so far defied scientific understanding.\n",
       "This has been called the Hard Problem of consciousness — a more accurate term would be the Intractable Problem.\n",
       "Before its stony face every sensible philosophical position seems to sink into absurdity.\n",
       "Consider: if consciousness has a purely functional definition — the capacity for self-regulation, let’s say — then a thermostat is at least minimally conscious.\n",
       "Absurd.\n",
       "If functionalism falters, suppose we substitute materialism — the doctrine that everything in the natural world (including the subjective experience of an individual) is some form of physical matter.\n",
       "Could it be that consciousness is not only dependent on neural activity, but actually is neural activity?\n",
       "Then a neurosurgeon should be able to open up a living brain and see the consciousness inside it.\n",
       "Absurd.\n",
       "So it might seem we’re left with the famous dualism of Descartes — matter (brain included) is one kind of thing, and consciousness is something else altogether.\n",
       "But then the obvious correlations between neural activity and states of consciousness would appear to be some sort of odd coincidence.\n",
       "And how could a poet’s ethereal consciousness reach across the dark unfathomable chasm to cause an emerging poem to be scribbled on paper — an event situated firmly in the realm of matter?\n",
       "All absurd.\n",
       "The only indisputable statement to be made about consciousness is that no consensus exists among philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists, and AI researchers.\n",
       "Some neuroscientists believe they are on the threshold of providing a materialist account of consciousness , and some AI researchers believe machines will inevitably acquire consciousness as an emergent property when they reach some critical level of complexity.\n",
       "For what it’s worth (which I freely admit to be very little), I have no faith in these claims.\n",
       "The complexity argument seemed plausible a half century ago when computers were in their infancy.\n",
       "Today, consider a simple thought experiment: Which is more complex, the internet (including every computer attached to it), or the brain of a frog?\n",
       "The internet, I would say.\n",
       "And which is more likely to have some sort of inner experience, the internet or the frog?\n",
       "I’ll put my money on the amphibian.\n",
       "The only indisputable statement to be made about consciousness is that no consensus exists among philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists, and AI researchers.\n",
       "If every available philosophical account of consciousness appears to be absurd, logic leaves us with two possibilities: At least one of these accounts isn’t truly absurd after all (we just need to clarify things), or the correct account awaits an insight humankind has yet to be granted.\n",
       "Though I remain officially agnostic, for the purpose of the specific question that presently concerns us — can AI write authentic poetry?\n",
       "— the preponderance of evidence leads me to answer “no.” AI has no apparent path to inner experience, which I (and many others) take to be the ultimate source of authentic poetry.\n",
       "A major corollary of this conclusion deserves to be stated: Inner experience can’t be defined as a computational process.\n",
       "What AI has already accomplished is spectacular, and its further advances will continue to change the world.\n",
       "But for all the functions an AI can potentially achieve — the ability to converse intelligently with humans in their natural languages, to interpret their emotions based on facial expression and tone of voice, even to create new artistic works that give humans pleasure — an intelligent program will fall short of authenticity as a poet.\n",
       "AI lacks what is most needed to place the footprints of its own consciousness on another mind: inner experience.\n",
       "That is, experience shaded by the accumulated memories derived over a lifetime.\n",
       "The absence of inner experience also means that AI lacks what is most needed to appreciate poetry: a sense of poetic truth, which is grounded not in objective reality but rather in subjective experience.\n",
       "It remains to be seen whether AI poems will eventually go beyond intended or unintended parody and trigger emotional responses in human readers that run deeper than wry amusement.\n",
       "Considered as texts, will AI poems reach some level confusable with human greatness, or will poetry created without inner experience inevitably press in vain against some inherent limit?\n",
       "Current AI poets are in essence mining the metaphors that humans have already formed and planted in texts — in the view of Robert Frost, “The richest accumulation of the ages is the noble metaphors we have rolled up.” Could AI create genuinely novel metaphors, rather than only variations of those we humans have come up with already?\n",
       "Borges thought that truly new metaphors still await discovery.\n",
       "New variations of old metaphors can be very beautiful, he acknowledged, “and only a few critics like myself would take the trouble to say, ‘Well, there you have eyes and stars and there you have time and the river over and over again.’ The metaphors will strike the imagination.\n",
       "But it may also be given to us — and why not hope for this as well?\n",
       "— it may also be given to us to invent metaphors that do not belong, or that do not yet belong, to accepted patterns.” Keith J.\n",

       "By Walt Hunter Getty ; The Atlantic February 13, 2023 Share Save  One of the least discussed aspects of the AI language generator ChatGPT might be its ability to produce pretty awful poetry.\n",
       "Given how difficult it is to teach a computer how to recognize a syllable, I’m not disparaging the technical prowess of the chatbot’s creators and testers.\n",
       "But very few of the AI-produced poems I’ve read actually follow the prompt that’s been provided.\n",
       "“Write a poem in the style of Seamus Heaney”?\n",
       "This is not that poem: In a garden green and fair, A flower blooms, a sight so rare.\n",
       "But is it meant for me, I fear?\n",
       "Will I, like it, bloom this year?\n",
       "Odds are good that this poem, titled “Is It for Me?,” will not win the National Poetry Series.\n",
       "The final phrase seems plucked from T.\n",
       "S.\n",
       "Eliot’s “ The Waste Land ,” which gives the last line an unintended comic air, because Eliot is referring to a corpse.\n",
       "Read: T.S. Eliot saw this all coming Poetry, with its heightened states of emotion, intimate address, ecstatic proclamation, and enchanting song, would seem to be one of the limit cases that prove the point: ChatGPT can write anything we can write.\n",
       "It can indeed compose poems from prompts such as “write a poem about the estate tax.” Asked to write a sonnet about socks, it will produce a poem with the opening line “Oh socks, my trusty companions on my feet.” Such goofy attempts could be said to emulate praise poetry, that venerable form of ode-making.\n",
       "They could just as well have been spoken by Brick Tamland, Steve Carell’s character in Anchorman , who is prone to spouting cryptic one-liners—including, famously, “I love lamp.” (As a teacher of poetry, I can’t help but imagine an overly eager chatbot in one of my creative-writing workshops in the year 2030.\n",
       "“Do you really love the lamp,” I picture myself asking it, “or are you just saying that because you saw it?”) Heaney wrote a poem about the death of his mother called “Clearances” that—like the AI-generated “Is It for Me?”—also uses rhyme, meter, and nature imagery: I thought of walking round and round a space Utterly empty, utterly a source Where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place In our front hedge above the wallflowers.\n",
       "The difference between ChatGPT’s Heaney-esque poem and Heaney’s actual poem is not simply that one is bad and one is good, or that one is sentimental and one is elegiacally beautiful.\n",
       "The difference is that Heaney lost his mother, and the poem expresses the emotional urgency of this fact during a reflective moment sometime after the event.\n",
       "Heaney’s poem carries the ineffable sense that the poet has not only pillaged from the horde of words that already exist but has also worked on them himself, claiming them partly as his and partly as a treasure loaned to him from centuries of poetry written in English.\n",
       "I could point to other aspects of the language: the pause in the second line, the similarity between the sounds of decked and chest -, the lingering syllables of wallflowers .\n",
       "Above all, there’s the mystery of the mourning poet’s meditation—that missing tree that both orients and eludes him.\n",
       "ChatGPT can write poemlike streams of regurgitated text, but they don’t mourn and console and mystify with an image like the chestnut tree, which casts an immersive spell.\n",
       "They don’t satisfy the minimal criterion of a poem, which is a pattern of language that compresses the messy data of experience, emotion, truth, or knowledge and turns those, as W.\n",
       "H.\n",
       "Auden wrote in 1935, into “memorable speech.” Ian Bogost suggests that ChatGPT produces “an icon of the answer … rather than the answer itself.” This is correct: The poem it spits out is an emblem of what a poem is rather than an example of a poem.\n",
       "It is closer to a found object than to Emily Dickinson’s four-line poems in rhyme, which take “unorthodox, subversive, sometimes volcanic propensities” and channel them “into a dialect called metaphor.” That’s what the poet Adrienne Rich found in Dickinson’s poetry—a hint as to how poems are made, a trace of their creation.\n",
       "Rich thought it was critically important that a poet’s imagination be followed back to her confining circumstances.\n",
       "For Dickinson, that was a house in Amherst in the 1860s and ’70s.\n",
       "For Rich, who wrote a century later, it was raising three children while questioning her sexuality and political commitments.\n",
       "Read: The encounter that revealed a different side of Emily Dickinson Not that the relation between the life and the poem is ever easy to make out: Indeed, Rich spent her career learning radically new ways to thread her experiences—as a mother, a homemaker in the suburbs, a lesbian, a feminist, a Jew—into language, changing the language in the process.\n",
       "She was like the poet she imagines in “Poetry: II, Chicago,” written in 1984: Wherever a poet is born     enduring depends on the frailest of chances: Who listened to your murmuring over your little rubbish     who let you be who gave you the books who let you know you were not alone Poems, she continues, are “fiery lines” that say, “ This belongs to you     you have the right / you belong to the song / of your mothers and fathers     You have a people .” They are almost always precarious in their transmission, whether they get to the poet from a god via Plato’s chain of magnetized iron or from the “inconstant wind” of human inspiration that Percy Bysshe Shelley likened to a fading coal.\n",
       "Now is not the time to give up on that essential strangeness and fragility in favor of productivity and predictability.\n",
       "The world needs more poems, not faster ones.\n",
       "ChatGPT cannot write poetry—or prose, for that matter—that is “the cry of its occasion,” as Wallace Stevens would have it, because there is no lived “occasion” other than the set of texts it can read.\n",
       "Neither can there be emotion recollected in tranquility.\n",
       "There’s no involuntary memory that’s stimulated by the taste of a madeleine.\n",
       "Creativity requires more than an internet-size syllabus or a lesson in syllables.\n",
       "So does essay writing, which is why, even though many acknowledge that ChatGPT can write passable high-school and undergraduate essays , I’m not concerned about that either.\n",
       "The poems that ChatGPT writes are riddled with cliché and wince-worthy rhymes, but it isn’t just issues of quality that separate AI- and human-generated compositions.\n",
       "Poetry, whether in the style of Heaney or Dickinson or your journal from fourth grade, comes from the felt necessity to speak a truth, whatever kind of truth that might be, in a tongue that you’ve inherited or learned—or that has been imposed upon you by force or violence.\n",
       "That’s obvious to anyone who, for reasons they can’t fully explain, sits down and organizes their words into a pattern that’s slightly different from the language they use at the dinner table.\n",
       "Whatever upgrades might come for ChatGPT, what it writes likely won’t emerge from the burning sense that something is missing from the world.\n",
       "Poetry speaks in the words of the dead, words sometimes borrowed from past poems—but the desire to use those words comes from an intuition that something is still hidden in them, something that needs to be heard in the harmony between our present voices and those earlier ones.\n",
       "The resemblance between AI-generated writing and human-generated writing is surface level.\n",
       "We know a little more now about how computers arrange words into patterns.\n",
       "The real question—the question that we keep trying to answer with vital metaphors of “fiery lines” and fading coals—is how humans do.\n",

       "(e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.\n",

       "Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.\n",
       "Governing Law and Venue These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles.\n",
