     15 Stunning HTML Websites in 2024 [+ How They Work]    Download Now: Free HTML & CSS Coding Templates        Colin Newcomer          Published: March 19, 2024       Building even a simple HTML website can feel overwhelming if you haven’t done it before.
In my experience, diving into examples can help make it feel less daunting.
  A successful HTML page example provides inspiration as you craft your own site and an example of what a successful site looks like in practice.
That’s why it’s worthwhile to take a look.
  One of the cool things about learning HTML is that you can take inspiration from any of the millions of public websites up and running right now.
And not just that — you can also peek at the underlying HTML of these websites to find out how they’re built, then use those same techniques to build your own projects.
 In this post, I‘ll share some stunning website examples that leverage HTML to its fullest potential.
Beyond that, you’ll also learn about the basics of HTML websites, how to build your own simple HTML website, and some ideas for different types of websites you might want to create.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a robust understanding of the best HTML page examples as you embark on your journey to craft your own.
   Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites    Ideas for Different Types of Websites You Can Build    15+ Advanced and Simple HTML Website Examples    How to Make Your Own HTML Website    HTML Page Example     Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language , is the primary language of the World Wide Web.
An HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page.
When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.
 HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts.
JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.
 The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5.
Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio and video and semantically rich elements to describe page structure.
 Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML.
That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008.
 If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our ultimate guide to HTML .
You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.
 Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it.
And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages like PHP (such as WordPress ).
With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query the site's database to generate the finished HTML document to deliver to visitors' browsers.
 You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life.
 Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways designers and developers harness HTML in their creative works.

 Access now     Learn more            A Few Ideas for HTML Websites  To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good idea for you to create a website or two from scratch.
 Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
 Here are some ideas for beginner-friendly simple HTML projects you can create:    A personal website.
Create a personal site that shows off your resume , work experience, interests, skills, and personality.
You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.
   An informational site.
Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches visitors about it.
You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll share some examples below.
   A small business website or a non-profit website.
You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your area.
Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.
   A blog.
While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.
A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
   A portfolio.
Want to show off your other creative works ?
Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery , a video showcase, or a collection of your writing .
The best part?
We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML .
   To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
  As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices.
But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
  Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively.
I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.
    HTML Website Examples    Gloutir  Canvas Study  Melba Design Festival  Understanding Neurodiversity  Intelligent Video Solutions  Caffeine Post  Dumpling Delivery  Make Your Move (Adidas)  Take a Ride With Me  Ayako Taniguchi  Earth Eclipsed  Pencilvania  Mas Oyama  La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca       1.
 Gloutir   Image Source  What I like: Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website.
While the hero section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll down the page.
 At first glance, this site may look technically complex.
However, you can achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS.
While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
 It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious.
For example, when I checked out the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different HTML techniques that the site relies on.
 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.
 7.
Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.
The designers have achieved harmony between each element by employing web textures, color gradients, parallax scrolling effects, and a fascinating full-screen background animation on the homepage.
 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.
 14.
DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
 Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:  Static HTML Website Generator  If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
 If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static .
 You can build your website with WordPress , including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site.
You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins ( though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site ).
Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
 All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
 If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:    W ebflow ( like WordPress , it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)    Jekyll    Hugo    Gridsome    Eleventy    Pelican    Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)  If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
 Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
 You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer.
Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
 To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library.
For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components.
This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
 I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested.
We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons , building Bootstrap web forms , and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed.
  HTML Page Example  Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
 Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.
  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page.
As you can see, it's rather intuitive.
 Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML  We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes.
But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made.
With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience.

 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.
 7.
Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.
The designers have achieved harmony between each element by employing web textures, color gradients, parallax scrolling effects, and a fascinating full-screen background animation on the homepage.
 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.
 14.
DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
 Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:  Static HTML Website Generator  If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
 If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static .
 You can build your website with WordPress , including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site.
You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins ( though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site ).
Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
 All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
 If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:    W ebflow ( like WordPress , it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)    Jekyll    Hugo    Gridsome    Eleventy    Pelican    Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)  If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
 Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
 You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer.
Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
 To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library.
For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components.
This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
 I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested.
We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons , building Bootstrap web forms , and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed.
  HTML Page Example  Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
 Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.
  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page.
As you can see, it's rather intuitive.
 Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML  We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes.
But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made.
With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience.

And growing better means aligning the success of your own business with the success of your customers.
Win-win!        Our Story  In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah noticed a major shift in the way people shop and purchase products.
Buyers didn’t want to be interrupted by ads, they wanted helpful information.
In 2006, they founded HubSpot to help companies use that shift to grow better with inbound marketing.
 Along the way, HubSpot expanded beyond marketing into a crafted, not cobbled suite of products that create the frictionless customer experience that buyers expect today.
Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, HubSpot uses its customer platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help millions of scaling organizations grow better.

In my experience, diving into examples can help make it feel less daunting.
  A successful HTML page example provides inspiration as you craft your own site and an example of what a successful site looks like in practice.
That’s why it’s worthwhile to take a look.
  One of the cool things about learning HTML is that you can take inspiration from any of the millions of public websites up and running right now.
And not just that — you can also peek at the underlying HTML of these websites to find out how they’re built, then use those same techniques to build your own projects.
 In this post, I‘ll share some stunning website examples that leverage HTML to its fullest potential.
Beyond that, you’ll also learn about the basics of HTML websites, how to build your own simple HTML website, and some ideas for different types of websites you might want to create.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a robust understanding of the best HTML page examples as you embark on your journey to craft your own.
   Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites    Ideas for Different Types of Websites You Can Build    15+ Advanced and Simple HTML Website Examples    How to Make Your Own HTML Website    HTML Page Example     Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language , is the primary language of the World Wide Web.
An HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page.
When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.
 HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts.
JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.
 The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5.
Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio and video and semantically rich elements to describe page structure.
 Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML.
That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008.
 If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our ultimate guide to HTML .
You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.
 Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it.
And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages like PHP (such as WordPress ).
With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query the site's database to generate the finished HTML document to deliver to visitors' browsers.
 You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life.
 Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways designers and developers harness HTML in their creative works.

 Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
 Here are some ideas for beginner-friendly simple HTML projects you can create:    A personal website.
Create a personal site that shows off your resume , work experience, interests, skills, and personality.
You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.
   An informational site.
Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches visitors about it.
You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll share some examples below.
   A small business website or a non-profit website.
You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your area.
Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.
   A blog.
While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.
A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
   A portfolio.
Want to show off your other creative works ?
Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery , a video showcase, or a collection of your writing .
The best part?
We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML .
   To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
  As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices.
But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
  Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively.
I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.
    HTML Website Examples    Gloutir  Canvas Study  Melba Design Festival  Understanding Neurodiversity  Intelligent Video Solutions  Caffeine Post  Dumpling Delivery  Make Your Move (Adidas)  Take a Ride With Me  Ayako Taniguchi  Earth Eclipsed  Pencilvania  Mas Oyama  La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca       1.
 Gloutir   Image Source  What I like: Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website.
While the hero section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll down the page.
 At first glance, this site may look technically complex.
However, you can achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS.
While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
 It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious.
For example, when I checked out the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different HTML techniques that the site relies on.
 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.

Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.
The designers have achieved harmony between each element by employing web textures, color gradients, parallax scrolling effects, and a fascinating full-screen background animation on the homepage.
 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.
 14.
DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
 Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:  Static HTML Website Generator  If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
 If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static .
 You can build your website with WordPress , including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site.
You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins ( though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site ).
Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
 All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
 If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:    W ebflow ( like WordPress , it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)    Jekyll    Hugo    Gridsome    Eleventy    Pelican    Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)  If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
 Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
 You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer.
Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
 To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library.
For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components.
This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
 I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested.
We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons , building Bootstrap web forms , and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed.
  HTML Page Example  Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
 Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.
  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page.
As you can see, it's rather intuitive.
 Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML  We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes.
But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made.
With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience.

In my experience, diving into examples can help make it feel less daunting.
  A successful HTML page example provides inspiration as you craft your own site and an example of what a successful site looks like in practice.
That’s why it’s worthwhile to take a look.
  One of the cool things about learning HTML is that you can take inspiration from any of the millions of public websites up and running right now.
And not just that — you can also peek at the underlying HTML of these websites to find out how they’re built, then use those same techniques to build your own projects.
 In this post, I‘ll share some stunning website examples that leverage HTML to its fullest potential.
Beyond that, you’ll also learn about the basics of HTML websites, how to build your own simple HTML website, and some ideas for different types of websites you might want to create.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a robust understanding of the best HTML page examples as you embark on your journey to craft your own.
   Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites    Ideas for Different Types of Websites You Can Build    15+ Advanced and Simple HTML Website Examples    How to Make Your Own HTML Website    HTML Page Example     Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language , is the primary language of the World Wide Web.
An HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page.
When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.
 HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts.
JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.
 The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5.
Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio and video and semantically rich elements to describe page structure.
 Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML.
That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008.
 If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our ultimate guide to HTML .
You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.
 Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it.
And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages like PHP (such as WordPress ).
With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query the site's database to generate the finished HTML document to deliver to visitors' browsers.
 You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life.
 Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways designers and developers harness HTML in their creative works.

 Access now     Learn more            A Few Ideas for HTML Websites  To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good idea for you to create a website or two from scratch.
 Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
 Here are some ideas for beginner-friendly simple HTML projects you can create:    A personal website.
Create a personal site that shows off your resume , work experience, interests, skills, and personality.
You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.
   An informational site.
Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches visitors about it.
You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll share some examples below.
   A small business website or a non-profit website.
You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your area.
Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.
   A blog.
While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.
A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
   A portfolio.
Want to show off your other creative works ?
Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery , a video showcase, or a collection of your writing .
The best part?
We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML .
   To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
  As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices.
But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
  Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively.
I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.
    HTML Website Examples    Gloutir  Canvas Study  Melba Design Festival  Understanding Neurodiversity  Intelligent Video Solutions  Caffeine Post  Dumpling Delivery  Make Your Move (Adidas)  Take a Ride With Me  Ayako Taniguchi  Earth Eclipsed  Pencilvania  Mas Oyama  La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca       1.
 Gloutir   Image Source  What I like: Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website.
While the hero section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll down the page.
 At first glance, this site may look technically complex.
However, you can achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS.
While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
 It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious.
For example, when I checked out the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different HTML techniques that the site relies on.
 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.
 7.
Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.

 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.

DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
 Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:  Static HTML Website Generator  If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
 If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static .
 You can build your website with WordPress , including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site.
You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins ( though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site ).
Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
 All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
 If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:    W ebflow ( like WordPress , it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)    Jekyll    Hugo    Gridsome    Eleventy    Pelican    Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)  If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
 Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
 You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer.
Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
 To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library.
For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components.
This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
 I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested.
We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons , building Bootstrap web forms , and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed.
  HTML Page Example  Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
 Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.
  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page.
As you can see, it's rather intuitive.
 Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML  We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes.

In my experience, diving into examples can help make it feel less daunting.
  A successful HTML page example provides inspiration as you craft your own site and an example of what a successful site looks like in practice.
That’s why it’s worthwhile to take a look.
  One of the cool things about learning HTML is that you can take inspiration from any of the millions of public websites up and running right now.
And not just that — you can also peek at the underlying HTML of these websites to find out how they’re built, then use those same techniques to build your own projects.
 In this post, I‘ll share some stunning website examples that leverage HTML to its fullest potential.
Beyond that, you’ll also learn about the basics of HTML websites, how to build your own simple HTML website, and some ideas for different types of websites you might want to create.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a robust understanding of the best HTML page examples as you embark on your journey to craft your own.
   Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites    Ideas for Different Types of Websites You Can Build    15+ Advanced and Simple HTML Website Examples    How to Make Your Own HTML Website    HTML Page Example     Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language , is the primary language of the World Wide Web.
An HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page.
When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.
 HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts.
JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.
 The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5.
Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio and video and semantically rich elements to describe page structure.
 Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML.
That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008.
 If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our ultimate guide to HTML .
You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.
 Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it.
And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages like PHP (such as WordPress ).
With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query the site's database to generate the finished HTML document to deliver to visitors' browsers.
 You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life.
 Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways designers and developers harness HTML in their creative works.

 Access now     Learn more            A Few Ideas for HTML Websites  To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good idea for you to create a website or two from scratch.
 Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
 Here are some ideas for beginner-friendly simple HTML projects you can create:    A personal website.
Create a personal site that shows off your resume , work experience, interests, skills, and personality.
You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.
   An informational site.
Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches visitors about it.
You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll share some examples below.
   A small business website or a non-profit website.
You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your area.
Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.
   A blog.
While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.
A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
   A portfolio.
Want to show off your other creative works ?
Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery , a video showcase, or a collection of your writing .
The best part?
We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML .
   To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
  As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices.
But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
  Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively.
I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.
    HTML Website Examples    Gloutir  Canvas Study  Melba Design Festival  Understanding Neurodiversity  Intelligent Video Solutions  Caffeine Post  Dumpling Delivery  Make Your Move (Adidas)  Take a Ride With Me  Ayako Taniguchi  Earth Eclipsed  Pencilvania  Mas Oyama  La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca       1.
 Gloutir   Image Source  What I like: Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website.
While the hero section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll down the page.
 At first glance, this site may look technically complex.
However, you can achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS.
While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
 It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious.
For example, when I checked out the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different HTML techniques that the site relies on.
 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.
 7.
Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

 Access now     Learn more           11.
Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.
The designers have achieved harmony between each element by employing web textures, color gradients, parallax scrolling effects, and a fascinating full-screen background animation on the homepage.
 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.
 14.
DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.

In my experience, diving into examples can help make it feel less daunting.
  A successful HTML page example provides inspiration as you craft your own site and an example of what a successful site looks like in practice.
That’s why it’s worthwhile to take a look.
  One of the cool things about learning HTML is that you can take inspiration from any of the millions of public websites up and running right now.
And not just that — you can also peek at the underlying HTML of these websites to find out how they’re built, then use those same techniques to build your own projects.
 In this post, I‘ll share some stunning website examples that leverage HTML to its fullest potential.
Beyond that, you’ll also learn about the basics of HTML websites, how to build your own simple HTML website, and some ideas for different types of websites you might want to create.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a robust understanding of the best HTML page examples as you embark on your journey to craft your own.
   Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites    Ideas for Different Types of Websites You Can Build    15+ Advanced and Simple HTML Website Examples    How to Make Your Own HTML Website    HTML Page Example     Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites  HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language , is the primary language of the World Wide Web.
An HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page.
When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.
 HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts.
JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.
 The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5.
Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio and video and semantically rich elements to describe page structure.
 Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML.
That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008.
 If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our ultimate guide to HTML .
You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.
 Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it.
And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages like PHP (such as WordPress ).
With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query the site's database to generate the finished HTML document to deliver to visitors' browsers.
 You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life.
 Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways designers and developers harness HTML in their creative works.

 Access now     Learn more            A Few Ideas for HTML Websites  To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good idea for you to create a website or two from scratch.
 Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
 Here are some ideas for beginner-friendly simple HTML projects you can create:    A personal website.
Create a personal site that shows off your resume , work experience, interests, skills, and personality.
You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.
   An informational site.
Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches visitors about it.
You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll share some examples below.
   A small business website or a non-profit website.
You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your area.
Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.
   A blog.
While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.
A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
   A portfolio.
Want to show off your other creative works ?
Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery , a video showcase, or a collection of your writing .
The best part?
We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML .
   To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
  As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices.
But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
  Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively.
I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.
    HTML Website Examples    Gloutir  Canvas Study  Melba Design Festival  Understanding Neurodiversity  Intelligent Video Solutions  Caffeine Post  Dumpling Delivery  Make Your Move (Adidas)  Take a Ride With Me  Ayako Taniguchi  Earth Eclipsed  Pencilvania  Mas Oyama  La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca       1.
 Gloutir   Image Source  What I like: Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website.
While the hero section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll down the page.
 At first glance, this site may look technically complex.
However, you can achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS.
While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
 It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious.
For example, when I checked out the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different HTML techniques that the site relies on.
 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.
 7.
Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

 Access now     Learn more           11.
Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.
The designers have achieved harmony between each element by employing web textures, color gradients, parallax scrolling effects, and a fascinating full-screen background animation on the homepage.
 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.
 14.
DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
 Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:  Static HTML Website Generator  If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
 If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static .
 You can build your website with WordPress , including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site.
You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins ( though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site ).
Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
 All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
 If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:    W ebflow ( like WordPress , it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)    Jekyll    Hugo    Gridsome    Eleventy    Pelican    Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)  If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
 Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
 You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer.
Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
 To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library.
For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components.
This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
 I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested.
We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons , building Bootstrap web forms , and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed.
  HTML Page Example  Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
 Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.
  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page.
As you can see, it's rather intuitive.
 Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML  We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes.
But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made.
With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience.

While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own.
A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.
   A portfolio.
Want to show off your other creative works ?
Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery , a video showcase, or a collection of your writing .
The best part?
We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML .
   To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp.
  As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices.
But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience.
  Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively.
I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.
    HTML Website Examples    Gloutir  Canvas Study  Melba Design Festival  Understanding Neurodiversity  Intelligent Video Solutions  Caffeine Post  Dumpling Delivery  Make Your Move (Adidas)  Take a Ride With Me  Ayako Taniguchi  Earth Eclipsed  Pencilvania  Mas Oyama  La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca       1.
 Gloutir   Image Source  What I like: Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas, that features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website.
While the hero section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons of interesting effects as you scroll down the page.
 At first glance, this site may look technically complex.
However, you can achieve most of the effects with plain HTML and CSS.
While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
 It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious.
For example, when I checked out the code, I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and some of the different HTML techniques that the site relies on.
 Check out our guide to the “inspect element” tool to learn how you can do the same.
 If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that Chrome offers the best developer tools (like “inspect element”).
However, most other browsers also offer developer tools.
 Pro Tip: Need help choosing a color scheme for your site ?
Here are a few I love.
 2.
 Joshua's World   Image Source  What I like: Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive Joshua‘s World website to connect with potential clients.
Visitors start on a simple welcome screen but can then enter the much more engaging Joshua’s World interface.
 Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s various projects and learning more about his experience.
I think it’s much more engaging than a traditional portfolio that lists projects as thumbnails.
And, given that Joshua is an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off what he can do.
 While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, the interactive elements rely on JavaScript.
Joshua also uses the Sanity content management system to help him manage his site’s content.
 Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's concept to reinforce what your website is trying to achieve.
Rather than just telling people about his skills as an interactive designer, Joshua shows people his skills.
 Pro Tip: Consider working with a web designer to create bespoke designs for your HTML site.
 3.
Ruby on Rails   Image Source  What I like: Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source development framework developers can use to build server-side web applications.
The Ruby on Rails website does a great job of communicating that with a clean, modern design.
 I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color and typography choices, rather than relying on more complex animations.
The red headings give a pop of color, while the actual design is simple.
 The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling.
None of the effects that you see require JavaScript.
For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
 I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript effects to build a great HTML website.
Those elements can help in certain situations, especially with engagement and storytelling ( as many of my other examples show ).
However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging website.
 Pro Tip: Make your website more engaging with thoughtful CSS animations .
Here are some I love.
(Don’t worry — it’s not too tricky to learn!)  4.
Understanding Neurodiversity   Image Source  What I like: Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its Understanding Neurodiversity project to educate the public about neurodivergent individuals, how they operate in society, and some common myths associated with these individuals.
 I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time.
It’s a touching blend of illustration, visual texture , music, sound effects, and meaningful storytelling to provide a better understanding of neurodiverse people.
 In particular, the website’s use of scalable vector graphic (SVG) artwork is stunning and adds a visual framework for communicating the site’s information.
Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with animated graphics.
As far as online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets.
 Pro Tip: Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your site.
This is something Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well.
 5.
Intelligent Video Solutions   Image Source  What I like: The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
 Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen videos, and video backgrounds .
Take this great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you down the page.
 If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way.
I think that it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page.
 Pro Tip: For accessibility reasons , it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and also to let them choose whether or not the video plays sound.
 6.
Caffeine Post   Image Source  What I like: Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes great use of the HTML video element.
I love how the homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive video montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.
 The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to watch a longer video preview with sound.
Plus, you can filter the works by category (commercial, film, etc.).
 For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many of its key features with just pure HTML.
I think it just shows how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.
 Pro Tip: Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in the world of your site.
The best part is adding video to an HTML page example is easy.
 7.
Dumpling Delivery   Image Source  What I like: Microsites allow brands to experiment with new web design techniques while promoting a product.
Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of virtual miniature golf in an attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers.
 Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening in the background to make the game dynamics possible.
Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can accomplish with HTML and JavaScript with some expert help.
 The only thing that I don't like is that the website can take a little longer to load on slower connections.
However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is going on with the site.
 Pro Tip: Love this site?
I do, too.
For more inspiration, take a look at some of our favorite interactive websites .
 8.
Make Your Move (Adidas)   Image Source  What I like: Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World of Sports headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
I like how it leverages video and crisp images to help you experience the space from every angle.
 The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the whole experience, starting with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) and following up with an image slideshow to highlight the best parts of working for the company.
 I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side movement, which I noticed creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience.
 Pro Tip: Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one.
This is a great example of using an HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible story about your brand.
 9.
Take a Ride With Me   Image Source  What I like: Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use it to immerse.
Created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe.
 This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and it’s accomplished with HTML video alone.
If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild effects to pull off a great site.
 That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for some added flair.
For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect ( and also makes it easy for visitors to start the experience ).
 Pro Tip: Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or if you’d be better off leaving it alone.
 10.
Ayako Taniguchi   Image Source  What I like: As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer of emotional depth to any browsing experience.
Let’s now turn to another example in which music is the focus: The website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
 The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages.
You can also set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control the playback of the sounds, as is the case with this site.
 Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background.
The canvas was configured to react to both the music and cursor movements, which I think gives the music more of an emotional impact than a simple pause or play button.
 It‘s a great example of how you can combine visual and audio effects to create or enhance a certain "feeling" in your website’s visitors.
 Pro Tip: I love how the music automatically pauses if a user opens another window, which I think reinforces how interactivity is an integral part of the experience.

Earth Eclipsed   Image Source  What I like: Here is another shining example of the HTML audio element in action: Earth Eclipsed is an award-winning science fiction podcast with an award-winning website — both were designed to transport you to a different place.
 I think this site's main highlight is its unique player interface.
The progress bar is laid out in a circle, and the time is displayed as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe.
This creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.
 The website also incorporates many engaging scroll and video effects, including a fun video of all the Earth Eclipsed team members clapping.
 Pro Tip: Combining audio and video can give your site a competitive edge in a space saturated by so many engaging websites.
 12.
Pencilvania   Image Source  What I like: Pencilvania is a digital project that shows you the latest dogs that have been put up for adoption in the US and Canada.
 The entire site is a draggable canvas that updates daily with new data and will hopefully encourage a visitor or two to adopt.
I like how it also includes engaging audio effects, with a cute dog bark sound when visitors select one of the new arrivals.
 In my opinion, this unique concept plays a big role in why the Pencilvania website received an Honorable Mention at Awwwards.
 I think that you can easily translate this simple concept to other kinds of websites.
You could have visitors explore your own virtual town, look for treasure, or feature different “landmarks” on your canvas that link out to other pages on your site or to your different projects.
In my opinion, the Joshua's World website from above is another great example of these tactics.
 Pro Tip: If you want your site to shine, offer users something they haven’t seen or experienced before.
Yes, you can do this with simple HTML — the concept matters most!  13.
Mas Oyama   Image Source  What I like: This website for this martial arts dojo displays mastery in controlling each design element to create an atmosphere.
The designers have achieved harmony between each element by employing web textures, color gradients, parallax scrolling effects, and a fascinating full-screen background animation on the homepage.
 I think that this site is also notable for its in-depth storytelling, detailing the history of the full-contact martial art of Kyokushin Karate and its founder, Mas Oyama.
Of course, you don’t need programming experience to know how to tell a great story.
But, when combined, they make for a powerful website.
 Again, I think that this is a great example of how you can use HTML elements to enhance your website's storytelling and connect with visitors.
 Pro Tip: The eye-catching branding especially stands out on this website.
This demonstrates how critical it is to have branding that feels intuitive to your brand.
 14.
DD.NYC   Image Source  What I like : DD.NYC is a creative design agency located in New York City, hence the name.
True to its creative agency roots, the DD.NYC website uses lots of interesting animations and scroll effects to create a more engaging experience for visitors.
 For example, I love how the cross lines and “innovating your industry” text follow the user's cursor.
It creates an interesting effect but without being annoying, like some other cursor effects can be.
 The DD.NYC also has a certain “Easter egg”-type feature, where you can trigger a special dark mode by clicking the boxy heart icon with the text “Don't press this heart.” It also uses this interesting clickable button design in other site areas, such as the “Send” button for the DD.NYC contact form .
 Pro Tip: This offers an excellent example of how you can use small effects and Easter eggs to create a more engaging web experience for your visitors.
 15.
La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca   Image Source  What I like: Let’s end with something truly unique: La Guía de Cirugía Cardíaca is a Spanish-language website that teaches patients and their loved ones about heart operations.
The goal is to guide the visitor through the process and alleviate any concerns they may have.
 The site presents a lot of its information on animated cards, which are created with SVG files controlled with JavaScript.
I think that the site does an excellent job of presenting these cards logically, from when a patient first receives their diagnosis to when they return home after treatment.
 Pro Tip: I love how the website uses some interesting scroll effects and cursor effects to keep visitors engaged once they scroll past the cards.
Further down the page, it also includes playable audio episodes for visitors who prefer an auditory experience, which is another great example of the HTML audio element.
  How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website  If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above.
 While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
 Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site:  Static HTML Website Generator  If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site.
 If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static .
 You can build your website with WordPress , including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site.
You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins ( though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site ).
Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.
 All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.
 If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites:    W ebflow ( like WordPress , it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)    Jekyll    Hugo    Gridsome    Eleventy    Pelican    Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)  If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch.
 Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier.
 You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer.
Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live.
 To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library.
For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components.
This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch.
 I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested.
We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons , building Bootstrap web forms , and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed.
  HTML Page Example  Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself.
 Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be.
  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page.
As you can see, it's rather intuitive.
 Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML  We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes.
But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made.
With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience.

 Download Now          Updated: 03/28/23   Published: 03/28/23        HTML is the foundation of basically every web page.
It’s how we tell browsers to structure content into paragraphs, headings, images, links, lists, forms, tables, buttons, and more.
If you’re interested in building a website, web development, or just coding in general, learning HTML is a great place to start.
  In this guide to HTML for beginners, we’ll learn what HTML is and what it’s used for.
Then, we’ll walk through how to write some basic HTML and review some of its most important elements and attributes.
We’ll end with a brief look at some resources you can use to continue learning and using HTML.
 Let’s get started.

          How to Write HTML           How to Use HTML           Common HTML Elements           Common HTML Attributes           How to Learn HTML                      What is HTML?
  HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the core language of the World Wide Web.
It defines the content and basic structure of web pages and web applications.
    First published by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, HTML is now used by 94% of all websites , and probably all the ones you visit.
But what is it, exactly?
 First, check out this short video for a quick definition of HTML, then we'll dive deeper:   As mentioned above, HTML is an acronym for “HyperText Markup Language.” Let’s break this down to better understand what HTML actually means.
 “HyperText” is text on a web page that contains references to another web page.
You probably know these as hyperlinks.
We use hyperlinks to jump to another section of the same page, a different page on the current website, or a completely new website.
Hyperlinks can also open a PDF, email, or multimedia, like a video or audio file.
 Linking information together in this way was a revolutionary step in building the web.
Together, HTML and the internet make it possible for anyone to access all types of information around the world, in any order they want.
 Moving on, “Markup” refers to how HTML “marks up” the page with annotations within the HTML file.
These annotations are not displayed on the web page itself.
Instead, they work behind-the-scenes telling the browser how to display the document to visitors.
We'll learn more about this markup soon.
 Finally, “Language” is the simplest part of the acronym to understand.
Like any language, HTML has a unique syntax and alphabet.
But what kind of language is it, exactly?
Let’s tackle this question next.

 Access now     Learn more           Is HTML a programming language?
 Whether HTML is or is not technically a “programming” language is an ongoing debate among web developers and experts.
While the majority defines HTML as a “markup” language (not a programming language) some argue the two aren’t mutually exclusive.
 All programming languages have some functional purpose — they need to “do” something, whether it be evaluating expressions, declaring variables, or modifying data.
JavaScript is the most widely-used programming language in web development .
Other popular programming languages include Python, Java, and C.
 Though it’s very useful as we’ll see, HTML doesn’t really “do” anything in this sense.
It simply gives browsers the content it needs to display.
HTML doesn’t care how the browser goes about displaying the content, as long as it’s displayed.
In other words, HTML has a structural purpose, not a functional one.
 Still, some developers use this same logic to argue that HTML is a programming language — it’s just a declarative programming language.
According to Professor David Brailsford from the University of Nottingham, declarative languages are more restricted than other languages, but that doesn’t make them any less of a programming language.
You can see his full argument in this video .
 With that in mind, let’s move on to what HTML is used for.
 What is HTML used for?
 HTML is primarily used for creating web pages.
HTML is free to use and ensures your text, images, and other elements are displayed as intended.
 With HTML, not only can you add headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements to your page — you can also embed images, videos, audio files, and other multimedia.
And, you can link to other web pages on the same website or from another site.
This allows visitors to easily navigate your website and jump between websites.
 Even after adding headings, images, and hyperlinks, you’d still have a very basic web page — and that’s by design.
HTML is purely for the content of a page.
It creates a simple base upon which you can add styling with another language called CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets).
With CSS, you can customize your styling and layouts, changing the color, font, and alignment of elements.
 HTML is used to create things other than web pages, too.
You can use it to:   make tables for organizing data  create forms for collecting user information, processing transactions, making reservations, or placing an order  create emails with HTML   Whether you want to create web pages, tables, forms, or emails, you'll need to know how to write HTML.
So, let’s break down the process next.
  How to Write HTML  Compared to other coding languages, HTML is relatively easy to read and understand, since it’s essentially plain English text with extra symbols here and there.
 The main building block of an HTML web page is an element.
An HTML element is a unit of information that tells the web browser what to render for the viewer.
An HTML element could be a piece of text like a paragraph, an interactive item like a button, or a section of the page like a header or footer.
 Here’s what a basic element looks like written out in HTML.
This element is called the <button> element, and creates a button on the screen that users can click with the mouse.
  Let's take a closer look at each component of an HTML element.
 HTML Tags  HTML elements are designated by tags.
Most elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening tags precede contain the element name enclosed by angle brackets (<>).
Closing tags are identical to opening tags, save for a slash (/) that precedes the element name.
 Tags contain an element’s content.
Content may be text, a media item, or even other elements.
 So, say you want to add a paragraph to your web page, the the paragraph contains the text “This is a paragraph.” You’ll wrap it with the HTML paragraph tags <p> and </p> .
So, the HTML will look like this:   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>  Simple as that.
Together, these three things are all you need make a paragraph element in HTML.
 Most HTML elements have an opening tag, a closing tag, and content in between these tags.
However, some HTML elements only have an opening tag — these are called empty elements.
 The line break element is a common empty element.
To add a line break in HTML, you just need to write <br> (for “break”), and a line break will be added.
 Also, element names are case-insensitive, meaning they can be written in uppercase or lowercase.
For example, the <p> tag can also be written as <P>.
However, you’ll almost always see element names written in lowercase.
 HTML Attributes  While all HTML elements need tags, only some require attributes.
An HTML attribute is text inside of the opening tag that provides additional information about the HTML element.
 An attribute is always found in the opening tag of an HTML element.
Most have the syntax name=“value” , though some attributes only require you to write the name without any assigned value.
 Some elements require certain attributes.
For example, an HTML image element ( <img> ) must always contain a source attribute ( src ) whose value is the image URL or file path.
Otherwise, the browser will not know what image to render.
 Similarly, the anchor element ( <a> ), which creates a hyperlink, must contain an href attribute with a value that specifies the link’s destination.
Otherwise, if a visitor clicks on the anchor element, the browser won’t send them anywhere.
 Other elements have attributes that aren’t essential to include, but are considered a good practice.
For example, the <img> element also takes the alt attribute , which contains image alt text .
The browser will still render the image if the alt attribute is not present in the <img> tag.
But, readers with low vision might have trouble understanding what the image conveys without an alternative text description.
So, it’s recommended that all non-decorative images have alt text and therefore use the alt attribute.
 Attributes can be written in any order inside the opening tag.
However, you cannot put multiple instances of the same attribute inside the same HTML tag.

 Access now     Learn more           How to Use HTML  To start using HTML, you’ll need a text editor .
A text editor is a software program for writing code.
Since an HTML file is in standard text format, any basic text editor will work for this tutorial.
 Your first step will be to download a free text editor to use.
Notepad++ is a good free text editor for Windows, and Sublime Text is a popular option for Mac.
Usually, you can search the text editor online and download a zip file from the download page.
Open the zip file, follow any instructions given to install the program, and open it.
 When you open the text editor, you’ll likely see an editor window like the one below.
This is where you’ll write your HTML code.
  With this editor window open, copy the HTML code below and paste it into the window.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
  	<h1>My First Heading</h1>
  	<p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>  We’ll explain what each of these elements means in the following section.
 Next, save the file and name it “index.html.” You can save it to your desktop or another folder.
 After saving the HTML file, you’ll be able to open this file in your web browser.
To do this, you can double click on the file, right-click and choose Open, or drag and drop the file icon into an open browser window.
It will look like this:   Now that you know how to use an HTML editor, let’s look at how to write the actual code.
 How to Create an HTML File  To build a website with HTML, you need to create an HTML file first.
This file will contain all the HTML for your web page and will be uploaded to your web server.
That way, when a visitor searches for your website, the server will send the HTML file to the visitor's browser, and the browser will render the page accordingly.
 In the last section, we made a very simple HTML file to open in your browser.
In this section, we’ll walk through the process of building out a more complex one.
 Step 1: Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
 To start, we’ll need declare the type of document as HTML.
Add the special code <!DOCTYPE html> on the very first line of the file.
Every HTML file starts this way.
  <!DOCTYPE html>  Step 2: Add an <html> element.
 Next, we’ll add the <html> element after the doctype declaration, also called the “root” element of the document because it contains all other elements in the document.
 On the line below the DOCTYPE declaration, add an <html> opening tag.
Below that, add a closing </html> tag.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>  Every other element in the document will be placed between these tags.
 Step 3: Add a language attribute.
 Within the opening tag of the html element, we’ll also add a lang (language) attribute .
This helps screen readers determine what language the document is in, making your website more accessible .
 Without a language attribute, screen readers will default to the operating system’s language, which could result in mispronunciations of the title and other content on the page.
 Since we’re writing this post in English, we’ll set the file’s lang attribute value to en .
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
</html>  Step 4: Add a head and body section.
 An HTML document consists of two parts: the head section and the body section.
The head section contains meta-information about the page as well as any internal CSS.
The browser does not display this information to users.
The body section contains all the information that will be visible on the front end, like your paragraphs, images, and links.
 To create these sections, we will add <head></head> tags and <body></body> tags inside the <html> section of the document.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>  You’ll also notice that the <head> and <body> tags are indented here.
This visually indicates to us that these tags are placed inside, or “nested” in, the <html> tags.
While indenting isn’t necessary and makes no difference in how the browser renders the document, it’s still common practice to indent your HTML for better readability.
 Step 5: Add a title in the head section.
 Next, in the head section, we want to name our document.
Write a name (we’ll go with “My HTML Page” in this example) and then wrap it in <title></title> tags.
We’ll also indent this <title> element so show that it is nested in the <head> section.
 In the head section, you'll want to name your document.
Write a name (we’ll go with “My HTML Page” in this example) and then wrap it in <title></title> tags.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  	<title>My HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>  Step 6: Add HTML elements in the body section.
 In the body section, let’s now add a heading and paragraph.
Write out the heading content and wrap it in <h1></h1> tags, then write out the paragraph content and wrap it in <p></p> tags.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  	<title>My HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  	<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>      We're committed to your privacy.

Here’s what our completed file looks on the front end.
 Below is how it would look on the front end.
Note that only the heading and paragraph from the body section are rendered.
 See the Pen HTML tutorial: final by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  As you can see, this is a pretty skeletal page.
To fill it, we need to learn some more page elements.
Page elements are elements that are actually rendered on the front end.
We’ve already used two of them, <h1> and <p> .
Let’s take a closer look at these page elements and others next.
 If you'd prefer to watch how a more complex HTML file is built out with images, links, forms, and other elements, check out this video:    Common HTML Elements  The first version of HTML consisted of just 18 elements.
Since then, more versions have been released with dozens of tags added in each one.
In the most recent version of HTML, HTML5 , there are 110 HTML tags.
 Don’t worry, though — there are only a handful that you’ll use the most often.
Below we’ll review the most common elements and their tags.
 Below we’ll review the most common elements and their tags.
 Paragraph (<p>)  The HTML paragraph element represents a paragraph.
By placing <p></p> tags around text, you’ll make that text start on a new line.
 See the Pen p example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
   Image (<img>)  The HTML image element embeds an image into the document.
It requires a src (source) attribute to render properly.
An alt attribute should also be included in case the image doesn’t load properly or the reader has a visual impairment.
 Here’s an example of an image with a source and alt attribute:  See the Pen img example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Headings (<h1>-<h6>)  The HTML heading elements represent different levels of section headings.
<h1> is the highest section level and the most prominent, whereas <h6> is the lowest and therefore least prominent.
 See the Pen headings example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Division (<div>)  The HTML content division (div) element is a generic block-level container.
Div elements help organize the code into clearly marked sections.
They also add line breaks before and after their content.
Otherwise, they do not affect the content or layout of the page unless styled with CSS.
 Here’s an example of div wrapped around an image:  See the Pen div example 1 by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Here, the image looks the same as it did without the div wrapper element.
That’s because no style information was given to this div element.
To change the appearance of the container and therefore the image inside that container, you’d need to add style information.
 Say, for example, you wanted to center the image .
Then you could use the following code to horizontally center the image on the page:  See the Pen div example 2 by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Span (<span>)  The HTML span element is a generic inline container.
Span tags do not inherently represent anything, but they are used to group phrasing content for two reasons.
 The first is to apply styling to a piece of text .
For example, if you’re creating drop caps , you can wrap the first letter of the opening paragraphs of each section of your article in span tags.
 See the Pen span example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  The second reason to use span tags is to group elements that already share attribute values.
For example, maybe you have a website for English speakers learning French.
The default language is set to English but on several pages, you might have a table with French terms in the first column and their English translations in the second column.
In that case, you can wrap the French terms in span tags with the language attribute set to “fr.”   Anchor (<a>)  The HTML anchor element creates a hyperlink.
The anchor element requires an href attribute, which species the destination of the link.
The destination can be another section on the same web page or another web page on the same site, or external websites, files, and email addresses.
 Here’s an example of a link nested in a paragraph:  See the Pen anchor example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Line Break (<br>)  The line break element creates a line break where it’s placed.
That means you can add it wherever you want the text to end on the current line and resume on the next.
This element can be used to display poems, song lyrics, or other forms of content in which the division of lines is significant.
 Below is an example of an address rendered in two ways: one using line break elements and one using paragraph elements.
 See the Pen Paragraph vs Line Break Element by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
    Unordered List (<ul>)  The HTML unordered list element is used for grouping items when the order doesn't matter.
Shopping lists, for example, don’t need to follow a particular order.
List items are defined by the <li> tag and wrapped in the <ul> element.
 Here’s an example of an unordered list.
Try adding some list items yourself and see how the list changes.
 See the Pen ul example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Ordered List (<ol>)  The HTML ordered list element is used for grouping items when the order matters.
Recipes, for example, should follow a particular order.
The steps must be defined by the <li> tag and then wrapped in the <ol> element.
 An ordered list will start at the number 1 by default.
If you’d like to start at another number, add a start attribute and set the value to the number you want.
 Here’s an example of an ordered list that starts at 1.
Try adding steps at different parts of the list:  See the Pen ol example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Emphasis (<em>)  The HTML emphasis element signals that the text inside it should be emphasized.
Browsers typically render text inside <em> tags in italics.
 Here’s an example of the emphasis wrapped around a paragraph and nested within a paragraph:  See the Pen em example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Strong (<strong>)  The HTML strong element indicates that the text it contains is of particular importance or urgency.
Browsers typically render the text in bold .
 See the Pen strong example by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Table (<table>)  The <table> element creates a table for organizing content.
It requires three other HTML elements:   <tr> defines a table row.
 <th> defines the table header  <td> defines the table data (i.e., the content of the table’s cells).
  Here's an example of a table:  See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
 Horizontal Rule (<hr>)  The horizontal rule element defines a horizontal line across a web page.
It can be used to mark any thematic change, like the next scene in a play, a new section of an essay, or the conclusion of an article.
 See the Pen Horizontal Rule element by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Select  The select element defines a dropdown list of options, from which a user can select one option (or multiple if allowed).
The select element is usually used in HTML forms for gathering user submissions.
It’s best for selecting one option out of many while maximizing space on the web page.
 See the Pen HTML-only Dropdown by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
   Common HTML Attributes  Attributes modify HTML elements in different ways.
They can change the appearance of the element, apply unique identifiers so the elements can be targeted by CSS, or provide necessary information to readers or screen readers.
 Attributes usually appear lowercase and as name/value pairs, with their values in quotes.
 Below we’ll take a look at the most common attributes.
 Style Attribute  The style attribute contains inline CSS.
This CSS will override any styles set in the head section of the document or in an external stylesheet.
It will only be applied to the HTML element that has the style attribute in its opening tag.
 Here’s an example of the attribute in HTML:   <p>This paragraph will be black by default.
</p>
<p style="color: #800000">This paragraph will be maroon.
</p>   ID Attribute  The ID attribute is used to identify a single element in an HTML file.
That means the value of an ID attribute should not be repeated inside the same file.
Using this unique value, you can target a single element with internal or external CSS.
 Here’s an example of the attribute in HTML:   <h1 id=”decorative”>Title in Fancy Typography</h1>  Class Attribute  The class attribute is used to identify a group of elements under the same name and customize that group, effectively creating a new group of elements.
 Bootstrap buttons , for example, are all labeled with the .btn class so they have the same basic style: 14px font, medium size, rounded edges, etc.
 Here’s an example of the attribute in HTML:   <button class="btn" type="submit">Button</button>   Language Attribute  As mentioned, the language attribute signals to screen readers what the primary language of the web page is and when they need to switch to another language.
This is a small detail that can make your content more accessible to all readers, no matter what region they’re from or the language they speak.

 Access now     Learn more           While this attribute is most commonly embedded in the HTML element, it can also be used with paragraph, div, span, and other elements.
 Here’s an example of the attribute in HTML:   <p lang="fr">Cette phrase est en fran&ccedil;ais</p>
<p lang="es">Esta frase es en espa&ntilde;ol.</p>   Href Attribute  An href attribute contains the destination of a link.
This attribute must always be included with an anchor element.
 Here’s an example of the href attribute in HTML:   <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hubspot.com">go to HubSpot.com</a>   Source Attribute  Just like an anchor element needs an href attribute, an image needs a source attribute.
This contains the path to the image file or its URL.
 Here are two examples of the attribute in HTML:   <img src="images/pineapple.png">
<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/07/30/11/05/pineapple-867245_960_720.jpg">   Alt Attribute  The alt attribute provides descriptive information about the HTML element.
This is important for readers with visual impairments and for all readers in case the element doesn’t load.
In that case, readers will still be able to glean what the element was meant to convey.
Like the source attribute, you’ll most often find the alt attribute with the image element.
 Here’s an example of the attribute in HTML:   <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/07/30/11/05/pineapple-867245_960_720.jpg" alt="Pineapple in grass">  Data-* Attribute  The data-* attribute is used to store custom data that is private to the page or application.
You can use this stored data in the document’s JavaScript to create a more dynamic experience for the user.
 The asterisk in the data-* attribute can be any value.
 Here’s an example of the attribute in HTML from W3Schools:   <ul>
  <li data-animal-type="bird">Owl</li>
  <li data-animal-type="fish">Salmon</li>
  <li data-animal-type="spider">Tarantula</li>
</ul>  I could then use this data in the JavaScript to trigger a pop-up message providing more information about each list item.
Say, for example, a visitor clicked on the word “Owl.” Then a pop-up box would appear saying “The owl is a bird," as shown in the screenshot below.
  Now that we’ve covered the most common elements and attributes in HTML, let’s explore where you can practice writing this language and continue learning more about it.
  How to Learn HTML  There are hundreds of resources available to learn HTML for beginners or more advanced developers.
Depending on your learning style, you may prefer to read blog posts, watch video tutorials, take online courses, download an ebook, or use a combination of all of these resources.
 Below we’ll walk through at least one example of each of these content types.
That way, no matter what type of learner you are, you can find a resource that will help you learn this language.
 1.
The Beginner's Guide to HTML and CSS for Marketers  If you're just starting to learn to code , this free e-book is designed to teach HTML for beginners.
It will explain what HTML and CSS are, how they’re different, and how to get started if you're brand new to web development .

LinkedIn Learning  If you’re a visual learner, check out the online tutorials available at LinkedIn Learning (formerly known as Lynda.com).
LinkedIn Learning offers 42 courses and over 5,000 video tutorials that cover virtually every HTML topic, from forms to semantic data to everything in between.
These lessons are organized into three levels — beginner, intermediate, and advanced — so you can develop your skills over time.
To get access to all content on the site, you can sign up for a monthly or annual subscription.
 The video below is an excerpt from one course called “HTML Essential Training” by Jen Simmons:   3.
Codecademy  If you’re overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of videos available on LinkedIn Learning, try Codeacdemy’s Learn HTML class.
This online course will start with the basic structure and elements of HTML.
You can then put your knowledge to the test by building out more complex elements and projects, including HTML tables and forms, from scratch.
 While you can complete most of the course for free, there are pro features like quizzes and projects that you’ll have to pay to unlock.
  4.
HTML 4.01 Tutorial by W3C  W3C offers a range of training materials for HTML and CSS.
While these tutorials aren't interactive, they're jammed-packed with information relevant to both beginner-level and advanced developers.
 Don't worry about the interactivity of the courses, as W3C provides a reference page that breaks down the material week by week.
In week one you're learning the basics of HTML and its syntax then by week four you're off creating stylesheets and building full sections for your web page.
  5.
Learn HTML  Learn HTML is a free interactive tutorial.
However, rather than try to be the most comprehensive resource on HTML, Learn HTML offers a short step-by-step guide for building out a web page.
At every step, you can test whether you understood the lesson by completing an exercise in the online code editor.
If your code matches the expected output, then you’ll get a success message and be invited to move onto the next lesson.
  6.
HTML Beginner Tutorial by HTML Dog  HTML Dog created an HTML Beginner Tutorial for those who have absolutely no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS.
It starts with a general overview of what HTML is and what it’s made of (tags, elements, and attributes).
Then it walks through how to build out an HTML file with titles, paragraphs, headings, and other elements.
By the end, you’ll have walked though how to create a complete HTML file.
 This is similar to W3Schools and Learn HTML — but it invites you to build out the HTML file in your editor of choice, instead of a built-in one.
It specifically recommends Notepad.
 7.
HTML Specification by W3C  The HTML spec by W3C is the living standard for HTML.
While it’s not the easiest introduction to the topic, it is the most comprehensive.
That’s why we recommend checking it out once you’ve gone through some courses or tutorials and have established some familiarity with web technologies.
  Now you’re ready to code.
 HTML is the language we use to talk to computers.
It is how browsers display text, images, paragraphs, and other elements on a web page.
 As such, HTML is the predominant language of the World Wide Web.
That makes the language important not only to people trying to become programmers, but to marketers like yourself.
Knowing the basics of this markup language will allow you to make changes to your website without needing to rely on a developer, saving you and your business time and money.

[FAQs]    Download Now: An Intro to HTML & CSS for Marketers Guide        Dan Lyons     Updated: February 18, 2020   Published: September 16, 2013       Here at HubSpot we often recommend using your corporate blog to answer questions for your customers.
Lately we’ve been taking our own advice and using the HubSpot Inbound Marketing Blog to address questions that people ask when they call in to HubSpot’s Sales and Service representatives.
 Today’s question: What is CSS?
 This is one we get a lot.
It’s one of those things where a lot of people have heard the initials but most don’t know what they stand for.
Out of the 7 billion people on the planet, we’re guessing that 6.999 billion don’t know what CSS is.
 Once you do know what CSS is, you may discover that you actually don’t need to know what it is, because you’ll never have to deal with it -- you have designers or agencies that are handling your CSS needs.
But we get it.
You’re curious.
Knowledge is power.
And it's good to be well versed in the language your designers and agencies use.
So here goes.
  What is CSS?
 CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
Basically, CSS is a language that manages the design and presentation of web pages -- the way things look.
It works together with HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, which handles the content of web pages.
 With CSS you can create rules to tell your website how you want it to display information.
And you can keep the commands for the style stuff -- fonts, colors, and so on -- separate from the commands for the content.
 They’re called “cascading” because you can have multiple style sheets, with one style sheet inheriting properties (or “cascading”) from others.
 For a lot of people a plain old blog template is good enough.
It’s only when you want to start customizing the look of a site that you need to delve into CSS.
 Three Style Sheets  There are three kinds of CSS style sheets: external, internal, and inline.
 External styles control how things look across many pages on a website.
 Internal styles control the look of just one page.
 Inline styles control just one element of a single page, even just a single word.
 For more info on how these style sheets work together or “cascade” into one another, see this great tutorial from HubSpot.
 Put simply, you can use multiple style sheets, and they will know how to defer to one another.
Basically, inline overrides internal, and internal overrides external.
 According to this CSS tutorial , you’re better off relying mostly on external styles, and avoiding the one-off stuff as much as possible.
 You write out CSS commands and create a style sheet using a text editor.
Then you link that style sheet to your HTML, and, voila, your site will now obey the rules you’ve set forth in the CSS style sheet.
 There’s a lot more to CSS than what can be covered in a blog post.
For example, as with any language, there’s a syntax that you have to learn, and we can’t cover that here.
But if you're itching to get started ...
 Just Enough to Be Dangerous  CSS code looks kind of weird at first glance.
To give you an idea what it looks like, we've cribbed an example from a Mashable article on CSS.
Take a look:  a:link {color:red;} a:visited {color:purple;}  Translation: an unvisited link will appear in red, and a link that's been visited will be purple.
 But it's not as techie as it seems.
And again, a lot of people don’t ever need to touch CSS.
However, if you do want to do some customization, you’ll need to come up to speed on CSS.
If so, your best bet is to buy a book like this one to get caught up to speed, and then -- just start hacking away.
The more you practice, the better and more fluent you'll be.

Regardless of how you cut it, this technology creates robust software for companies worldwide.
In addition, companies like LinkedIn and Medium use it to create platforms for users to access their services.
 JavaScript can create different kinds of software such as games, computer programs, web applications, and even technologies like blockchain.
However, JavaScript is arguably the most popular programming language for the web.
For example, more than 125,000 jobs on LinkedIn are looking for working professionals skilled in JavaScript.
 Now that we've discussed the scope of JavaScript in the working industry let's talk more about its most common use, web development.

           JavaScript for Web Development  JavaScript's most popular use is for web development , and it is one of the most powerful tools a developer can have on their toolbelt.
Developers use JavaScript in web development to add interactivity and features to improve the user experience and make the internet much more enjoyable.
 JavaScript has expanded well beyond front-end development, which is where it started.
More recently, JavaScript has expanded to the back end of web development and can be used across the full stack.
This means that developers have front-end access to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) methods and can now even be used on the back end of a website.
 Furthermore, according to W3techs, over 90% of all websites use JavaScript .
This makes it the most prominent leader in web development technology.
Let's look at some more specific uses of JavaScript in web development.
  Front-End Interactivity : Web development is only made better by the increased interactivity and features that JavaScript offers.
 Web Applications : Web applications are similar to websites, but instead, they get packaged into a neat little box, which improves control over security and more.
 Browser Games : The modern web browser has come a long way; developers even make robust games that function in a browser.
 Back End Web Development : Web development has come a long way, and now JavaScript is so robust it can even be used to manage the back end of websites and web applications.
  Here’s an illustration of all the possible use cases of JS today:   Image Source  Now that we've discussed the different ways JavaScript can be used, let's talk about how JavaScript works.
  How does JavaScript work?
 JavaScript is considered a client-side scripting language, which means that it operates on the user's browser and does not function on an external device.
An example of a language that is not client-side would be MySQL, a server-side language that handles any database requests.
 JavaScript also does not require that anything be downloaded to the user's devices, as modern browsers have the required software integrated into them.
This makes JavaScript much more user-friendly than some other languages can be.
 This image is an example of how JacaScript works behind the scenes, which is different from what we see.
  Image Source  Now that you have a better idea of how JavaScript works, let's move on to discussing how to use JavaScript in a website.
 How to Add JavaScript to Your Website  Adding JavaScript to your website is easy; you just need to link your JavaScript files from within your HTML files.
If you have any experience working with HTML and CSS for web development, then you've already experienced something similar.
 Much like adding CSS to your HTML , there is an HTML tag called "script" that allows you to link to JavaScript files so that your code can be used to manipulate the HTML and CSS of your website.
 Let's take a look at what the HTML script tag looks like.
The following line of code is an example of the script tag and its syntax.
  <script src="yourFile.js"></script>  The above line connects a file called "yourFile.js" (horrible naming convention, but it serves as an example) to your HTML file connecting the two.
This allows you to write your code in a separate file, which keeps your HTML clean and easier to manage.
Using the script with the src attribute is also widely considered the best practice, as it keeps your code separate from each other, making it easier to update and change as needed with minimal issues.
 The script tag with src isn't the only way to add JavaScript to your site, though let's look at another way.
The script tag can also inject JavaScript code directly into your HTML.
So let's take a look at that next.
  <script type="text/JavaScript">JavaScript code goes here</script>  It is simple enough to complete, and it doesn't look much different from adding JavaScript externally.
 Noteworthy caveat : Because the browser handles JavaScript, it is important to consider that not all browsers will support all JavaScript features.
Furthermore, not all browsers will even have JavaScript enabled, be sure to plan for that possibility.
 Now that you understand how to add JavaScript to a website, check out an example of what JavaScript code looks like below.
  JavaScript Example  JavaScript is robust and can be used to perform some awesome things.
Regardless of what your design plans are or what you hope to build, there are some rules that JavaScript requires you follow.
Next we’ll look at a video discussing the syntax and rules for JavaScript.
   Now let's look at a great example of how you can create a simple color changer using a pseudo-random number generator.
 /*Function for generating a hex number for new random BG colors*/

function randomBgHex() {
  let randomHex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 900000) + 100000;
  document.querySelector("body").style.backgroundColor = `#${randomHex}`;
} /*end randomBgHex*/  The above code is a great example of how one can create a powerful feature with only a few lines of code.
This may look like a lot, so let's start by dissecting this into more manageable chunks of code.
 We start by declaring a function named randomBgHex .
  function randomBgHex(){}  Then you create a variable called randomHex .
And assign it the value of a mathematical equation.
  let randomHex = Math.floor(Math.random()*900000) + 100000;  The above code uses the Math object and the .floor() method to return the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
Next, the number gets generated using the .random(), which — without a parameter — returns a number between zero and less than one.
So you multiply that result against 900,000 plus 100,000.
This equation ensures that the number you get will match the needs of a hexadecimal number.
 The value of this equation is then stored in the variable and used to create our colors.
The following line of code will target the HTML element and attribute you wish to change and then insert the hex number using a string literal.
  document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = `#${randomHex}`;  The first part of the code above selects the body of the HTML and targets the background color.
The second part `#${randomHex}` uses a string literal (identified by the backtick ") allows you to concatenate — or join — the # which identifies a hexadecimal number with the value inside of our variable randomHex .
 The result of this would equate to something similar to the following.
  #236789  The above hexadecimal gives you a lovely somber blue color.
 You can see this code in action by visiting the GitHub repo I created associated with the following image.
 Image Source  This code as a whole would generate a random color for the background of the HTML body on each page load.
This code, at one point, would be considered "Vanilla JavaScript." However, since there is now a library called Vanilla JS, it's better to refer to it as "Standard JS" to avoid confusion.
 With that said, it should be noted why the distinction is so important.
Programming language libraries use a slightly different syntax than the language for which they were built.
So let's look at some examples of JavaScript libraries and the difference between them and the standard code.
  JavaScript Libraries  There are several JavaScript libraries out there that can help improve the speed and clarity of your coding efforts.
Libraries help keep your code clean and maximize the speed and efficiency of writing your programming code.
However, as a result, the syntax often changes, so there is a learning curve for each library.
 Let's look at a couple of examples of libraries that you can use in your workflow.
 Jquery JavaScript Library  Jquery is the go-to library for JavaScript programming due to its age and flexibility of use.
Furthermore, it improves efficiency and adds even more functionality to the programming language by building from its new features.
But, first, let's look at how the syntax differs from traditional JavaScript.
  $('#overlay').on( "click", '#prev', function(){
   currIdx--;
   if (currIdx < 0) {
      currIdx = 11;
   }
}  This example looks complex, but let's focus on just one point, the outermost function of this code.
  $('#overlay').on( "click", '#prev',function(){}  This code is valid Jquery, but without including the Jquery library, this would throw an error if you used it with traditional JS.
This code also includes two things worthy of note: the $ selector, a shorthand method for targeting HTML objects.
And the .on() method is an event listener that listens for a "click" in the browser window.
 Another popular library is known as React.
Let's talk about what React is and how it differs from standard JS.
 React JavaScript Library  The React library is a popular library created to help facilitate the development of web applications.
It is robust and today has a whopping number of open source contributors that add to, test, and maintain the library.
It operates differently from most libraries, and it is more complex, but let's look at the syntax just for clarity.
  class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div classname="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Bread</li>
          <li>Milk</li>
          <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}  As you can see, this is vastly different than your standard JavaScript code, or even Jquery for that matter.
In React, you declare your HTML within your JavaScript, and it gets rendered after the code runs, which is different than the standard web development approach.
 Many other libraries and Javascript frameworks are available for your workflow, and all have differences in syntax, features, and flexibility.
Choosing the right one for you will require some research into these factors and should be considered carefully.
 Start learning JavaScript today  This post provides everything you need to know to start your journey into learning JavaScript, including some industries and uses for it.
This post only covers an introduction to the language, so learning it is different.
 However, learning JavaScript is easy, and there are a lot of resources all over the internet on how you can learn to program with JavaScript.
Learning JavaScript does not require understanding web development, but it is probably the easiest way to practice your JavaScript programming skills.
 Other ways you can practice include using sites like CodePen that supply all of the software you need to learn and practice your work as a JavaScript developer.

Want to create animations?
Embed music and movies?
Build advanced applications that run in your browser?
You can with HTML5.
   In this post, we’ll cover everything you need to know about HTML5, including:   what it is  what’s the difference between HTML vs.
HTML5  what’s new in HTML5  how to use HTML5  when HTML5 came out  which browsers support HTML5    What is HTML5?
 HTML5 is the newest version of HTML .
The term refers to two things.
One is the updated HTML language itself, which has new elements and attributes.
The second is the larger set of technologies that work with this new version of HTML — like a new video format — and enable you to build more complex and powerful websites and apps.
 To understand how HTML has evolved over the years, let’s look at the differences between HTML and HTML5.

 Access now     Learn more            HTML vs HTML5  HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language.
Originally designed to semantically describe scientific documents, it has since evolved to describe much more.
 Most pages on the web today were built using HTML4.
Although much improved since the first version of HTML written in 1993, HTML4 still had its limitations.
It’s biggest was if web developers or designers wanted to add content or features to their site that weren’t supported in HTML.
In that case, they would have to use non-standard proprietary technologies, like Adobe Flash, which required users to install browser plugins.
Even then, some users wouldn’t be able to access that content or feature.
Users on iPhones and iPads, for example, wouldn’t be able to since those devices don't support Flash.
 Cue, HTML5.
HTML5 was designed to cut out the need for those non-standard proprietary technologies.
With this new version of HTML, you can create web applications that work offline, support high-definition video and animations, and know where you are geographically located.
 To understand how HTML5 can do all that, let’s look at what’s new in this latest version of HTML.
  What is new in HTML5?
 HTML5 was designed with major objectives, including:   Making code easier to read for users and screen readers  Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  Promoting design responsiveness and consistency across browsers  Supporting multimedia without the need for Flash or other plugins   Each of these objectives informed the changes in this new version of HTML.
Let’s focus on seven of those changes below.
 New Semantic Elements  HTML5 introduced several new semantically meaningful tags.
These include <section>, <header>, <footer> <nav>, <mark>, <figure>, <aside> <figcaption>, <data>, <time>, <output>, <progress>, <meter> and <main>.
These make it easier to write cleaner code that clearly delineates style from content, which is particularly important to users with assistive technologies like screen readers.
 Inline SVG  Using HTML4, you’d need Flash, Silverlight, or another technology to add scalable vector graphics (SVGs) to your web pages.
With HTML5, you can add vector graphics directly in HTML documents using the <svg> tag.
You can also draw rectangles, circles, text, and other vector-based paths and shapes using this new element.
Below is an example of a circular shape created using the SVG <circle> element.
 See the Pen Drawing a Circular Shape with inline SVG by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
    Form Features  You can create smarter forms thanks to HTML5’s expanded form options.
In addition to all the standard form input types, HTML5 offers more, including: datetime, datetime-local, date, month, week, time, number, range, email, and url.
You can also add date pickers, sliders, validation, and placeholder text thanks to the new placeholder attribute, which we’ll discuss later.
 WebM Video Format  Before HTML5, you needed browser plugins to embed audio and video content into web pages.
Not only did HTML5 introduce <audio> and <video> tags which eliminated the need for browser plugins, it also introduced the WebM video format.
This is a royalty-free video format developed by Google that provides a great compression to quality ratio.
This can be used with the video element and is supported by most browsers.
 Placeholder Attribute  HTML5 introduced the placeholder attribute.
You can use this with the <input> element to provide a short hint to help users fill in passwords or other data entry fields.
This can help you create better forms.
However, it’s important to note that this attribute is not accessible to assistive technologies.
Feel free to read more about the problems with the placeholder attribute .
 Server-sent Events  A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updated data from a server.
This was possible with HTML4, but the web page would have to ask  HTML5 supports one-way server-sent events.
That means, data is continuously sent from a server to the browser.
Think of how useful this would be if your website included stock prices, news feeds, Twitter feeds, and so on.
Server-sent events were supported in the previous version of HTML, but the web page would have to repeatedly request it.
 Local Web Storage  With the previous version of HTML, data is stored locally via cookies.
With HTML5, web storage is used in place of cookies thanks to a scripting API.
This allows you to store data locally, like cookies, but in much larger quantities.
 Now that we understand what’s new in HTML5, let’s take a look at why you should be using it on your website.
  Why HTML5?
 HTML5 offers a wide range of benefits over previous versions of HTML — some of which we’ve mentioned briefly above.
Let’s take a closer look at just a few reasons why HTML5 is so special.
 It’s compatible across browsers.
 HTML5 is supported by all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, as well as iOS for Chrome and Safari and Android browsers.
It can even work with the older and less popular browsers like Internet Explorer.
That means when building with HTML5, you know that users will have a consistent experience on your site, no matter what browser they use or whether they’re on mobile or desktop.
 It enables offline browsing.
 HTML5 allows you to build offline applications.
Browsers that support HTML5 offline applications (which is most) will download the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources that make up the application and cache them locally.
Then, when the user tries to access the web application without a network connection, the browser will render the local copies.
That means you won’t have to worry about your site not loading if the user loses or doesn’t have an active internet connection.

 Access now     Learn more           It allows you to write cleaner code.
 With HTML5’s new semantic elements, you can create cleaner and more descriptive code bases.
Before HTML5, developers had to use a lot of general elements like divs and style them with CSS to display like headers or navigation menus.
The result?
A lot of divs and class names that made the code more difficult to read.
 HTML5 allows you to write more semantically meaningful code, which enables you and other readers to separate style and content.
 It’s more accessible.
 Also thanks to HTML5’s new semantic elements, you can create websites and apps that are more accessible.
Before these elements, screen readers could not determine that a div with a class or ID name “header” was actually a header.
Now with the <header> and other HTML5 semantic tags, screen readers can more clearly examine an HTML file and provide a better experience to users who need them.
  How to Use HTML5  To start using HTML5 on your website, it’s recommended that you create an HTML template first.
You can then use this as a boilerplate for all your future projects moving forward.
Here’s what a basic template looks like:    <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=”en” manifest="/cache.appcache"> <head> <title>This is the Title of the Page</title> <meta charset="utf-8"> <link rel="stylesheet" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css"> <!-- This link is only necessary if you’re using an external stylesheet --> <style> /* These style tags are only necessary if you’re adding internal CSS */ </style> </head> <body> <h1>This is a Heading</h1> <p>This is a paragraph.</p> </body> </html>   Let’s walk through the process of building this file line-by-line so you can create an HTML template for your web projects.
You can follow along using a basic text editor like Notepad++.
  First, declare the type of document as HTML5.
To do so, you’d add the special code <!DOCTYPE html> on the very first line.
There’s no need to add “5” in this declaration since HTML5 is just an evolution of previous HTML standards.
 Next, define the root element.
Since this element signals what language you’re going to write in, it’s always going to be <html> in an HTML5 doc.
 Include a language attribute and define it in the opening tag of the HTML element.
Without a language attribute, screen readers will default to the operating system’s language, which could result in mispronunciations of the title and other content on the page.
Specifying the attribute will ensure screen readers can determine what language the document is in and make your website more accessible .
Since we’re writing this post in English, we’ll set the file’s lang attribute to “en.”  Also include the manifest attribute in your opening HTML tag.
This points to your application’s manifest file, which is a list of resources that your web application might need to access while it’s disconnected from the network.
This makes it possible for a browser to load your site even when a user loses or doesn’t have an internet connection.
 Create the head section of the doc by writing an opening <head> and closing </head> tag.
In the head, you’ll put meta information about the page that will not be visible on the front end.
 In the head section, name your HTML5 document.
Wrap the name in <title></title> tags.
 Below the title, add meta information that specifies the character set the browser should use when displaying the page.
Generally, pages written in English use UTF-8 so add the line: <meta charset = “UTF-8“ />.
 Below, add links to any external stylesheets you’re using.
If you’re loading Bootstrap CSS onto your project, for example, it will look something like this: <link rel="stylesheet" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">.
For the sake of this demo, I’ll include a dummy link and a comment in HTML noting that it’s optional.
 Now create the body section of the doc by writing an opening <body> and closing </body> tag.
The body section contains all the information that will be visible on the front end, like your paragraphs, images, and links.
 In the body section, add a header and paragraph.
You’ll write out the heading name and wrap it in <h1></h1> tags, and write out the paragraph and wrap it in <p></p> tags.
 Lastly, don’t forget the closing tag of the html element.
  When you’re done, you can save your file with the .html extension and load it into a browser to see how it looks.
      When did HTML5 come out?
  The first public draft of HTML5 was released by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) in 2008.
However, it was not released as a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation until October 28, 2014.
This recommendation was then merged with the HTML Living Standard by WHATWG in 2019.

 Access now     Learn more           To understand why the specification process spanned over a decade, let’s look at the complicated history of HTML5.
 In 1999, the year after HTML4 was released, the W3C decided to stop working on HTML and instead focus on developing an XML-based equivalent called XHTML.
Four years later, there was a renewed interest in evolving HTML as people began to realize the deployment of XML relied entirely on new technologies like RSS.
 In 2004, Mozilla and Opera proposed that HTML should continue to be evolved at a W3C workshop.
When the W3C members rejected the proposal in favor of continuing to develop XML-based replacements, Mozilla and Opera — joined by Apple — launched the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) to continue evolving HTML.
 In 2006, the W3C reversed course and indicated they were interested in participating in the development of the HTML5 specification.
A year later, a group was formed to work with the WHATWG.
These two groups worked together for a number of years until 2011, when they decided they had two separate goals.
While the W3C wanted to publish a finished version of HTML5, the WHATWG wanted to publish and continuously maintain a living standard for HTML.
 In 2014, the W3C published their “final” version of HTML5 and the WHATWG continued to maintain a “living” version on their site.
These two documents merged in 2019, when the W3C and WHATWG signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of HTML moving forward.
     Which browsers support HTML5?
  All the latest versions of major browsers — including Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Internet Explorer — support many HTML5 features but not all.
Currently, Chrome and Opera are the most compatible with HTML5, with Firefox and Safari following closely behind.
Internet Explorer is the least compatible, although it partially or fully supports most HTML5 features.
     Below is a table to show the varying compatibility of the major browsers.
Here's a key:   ✓ Fully supported  ≈ Partially supported  ✗ Not supported        Chrome  opera  Firefox  safari  Internet explorer    New semantic elements  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ≈    Inline SVG  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓    Expanded form features  ✓  ✓  ≈  ≈  ≈    WebM video format  ✓  ✓  ✓  ≈  ✗    Placeholder attribute  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ≈    Server-sent events  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✗    Local web storage  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓  ✓       If you want a more detailed breakdown of the different versions of browsers that support HTML5, check out Caniuse.com .
 HTML5 is the Future of the World Wide Web  With its new semantic elements, expanded form options, format-independent video tag, and more, HTML5 is revolutionizing how developers build web pages.
This, in turn, is changing consumers’ experiences online.
We can now watch videos without being asked to update Flash or download another software.
We can use applications when we don’t have an internet connection.
We can have the same great experience on a site whether using a cellphone, tablet, or Smart TV — and more.

Semantic HTML: What It Is and How It Improves Your Site    Download Now: Free HTML & CSS Coding Templates        Jamie Juviler     Updated: June 17, 2022   Published: April 27, 2021       HTML is the language of the web — it determines what content appears on a web page and in what order.
Those new to the language quickly learn that there are often several ways to create the desired effect with HTML and accompanying styling .
   However, not all methods are created equal.
Often, how you write your HTML is just as important as what your HTML shows to visitors.
 Specifically, I’m talking about semantic HTML , HTML code that says what it does.
In this introductory guide, I’ll introduce you to semantic HTML — what it is, how to write it, and why it’s important for every marketer and burgeoning web developer to adopt.
We’ll finish up by listing some common semantic elements to add to your tool belt.
  What is semantic HTML?
 Semantic HTML (also called semantic markup) is HTML code that uses HTML tags to effectively describe the purpose of page elements.
Semantic HTML code communicates the meaning of its elements to both computers and humans, which helps web browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, and human developers understand the components of a web page.
 The key to well-written semantic HTML is the use of semantic tags.
Semantic HTML tags have names that tell the person or machine reading the code what exactly they’re meant to do.
 Here’s a basic example: The <p> (paragraph) tag is a semantic HTML tag — all content between its opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag is a block of paragraph of text.
Anyone or any device reading this tag will understand its purpose.
 Some other common semantic HTML tags are:   <h1> , <h2> , <h3> , etc.: Headings on the page in descending order of importance.
 <a> : A hyperlink.
 <button> : A button element.
 <strong> and <emphasis> : These elements signal that the text inside them is important.
 <ol> and <ul> : Ordered and unordered lists, respectively  <header> and <footer> : Denote the header and footer sections of a web page.
  In each of these examples, the tag itself tells us exactly what the element is used for.
In fact, many HTML elements can convey meaning with their tags, as long as they’re being used for the correct purpose (e.g., not using a <p> tag for a heading or an <h2> tag for a paragraph).
 This then prompts the question: What HTML tags are non-semantic?
 The most common non-semantic, HTML tags are <div> , a generic block-level element, and <span> , a generic inline element.
While these tags are very useful for styling and formatting web pages, they don’t tell us much about the purpose of the content inside of them.
 Take a look at the example below.
Here, we have two identical button elements.
However, the first element uses the <button> tag while the second uses the <div> tag.
 See the Pen Semantic HTML - button vs div by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  This example illustrates how different tags can achieve the same visual results — to a sighted, human user, the experience of using these buttons is the same.
Even so, it’s always better to opt for the semantic implementation, in this case <button> .
Next, we’ll explore why semantic markup is better than generic markup.
 What are the benefits of semantic HTML?
 Semantic HTML not only makes your code neater and easier to read — it also makes it more accessible to assistive technology and search engines.
Let’s unpack each benefit below.
 Accessibility  Screen readers rely on semantically-rich HTML to process web pages and help users with low vision navigate them.
Semantic tags tell screen reader users where they are and how they can interact with the current page.
 If a page is structured as a wall of <div> and <span> tags, it won’t be clear to those who can’t see the page how the sections relate to each other.
The solution is semantic tags that divide a page into its constituent parts.
At a basic level, <header> and <footer> should enclose the header and footer sections of the page respectively, <main> contains the important page content, <nav> can contain navigational links, and <aside> can contain secondary page content like a sidebar.
 Many semantic elements also come with built-in keyboard accessibility.
When a screen reader sees a <button> element on a page, it allows this element to be “clicked” with the enter key.
The same can’t be said for the generic <div> — the tag alone does not tell the screen reader that this element acts as a button.
 As another example, when a screen reader detects a <table> element, users can use special keyboard controls to move up and down rows and across columns.
By writing clean, semantic HTML, you enable extra accessibility features with no extra work.
 Screen readers also let their users navigate the page more efficiently by jumping between like elements, or pulling up a list of similar elements to summarize page content — one more reason to use semantic tags appropriately.
 SEO  Like with assistive technologies, semantic markup helps search engine crawlers navigate your page to better understand its structure and contents.
Semantic HTML is a great way to show search engines what to index and get the most from your crawl budget.
 For example, the <main> tag encloses the main content of a page — use it to signal the unique parts of a page and avoid wasting indexing on repeated page elements.
Place the less important content inside <header> , <footer> , and <aside> , and use the <nav> tag to point to your navigation menu where bots can go for site-wide links.
 Human Readability  Web developers write and read hundreds of lines of code daily, so anything that makes their jobs easier is worth the effort.
Semantically rich markup allows developers to locate specific page elements more quickly than sifting through a pile of <div> tags.
Looking for the navigation on a page?
Simply conduct a search for the <nav> tag.
 Readability is especially important if you’re working on a team — you can’t expect fellow developers (or even your future self) to immediately understand your page from code alone.
However, the better you organize your content, the more quickly other developers will see the structure and the more efficient your development will be.
 Semantic HTML Tags  Since semantic HTML revolves around the proper use of tags, let’s review some common semantic tags you can implement on your site.
We’ve broken these tags down into those used on text, those used to communicate page layout, and other handy semantic tags.
 Semantic HTML Tags for Text  These tags convey the meaning of the text that they contain:   <p> (paragraph): A paragraph of text presented as a block.
 <h1> , <h2> , <h3> , <h4> , <h5> , <h6> (heading): A page heading.
<h1> is the top-level heading, and there should only be one per page.
The proceeding tags are ordered by descending importance.
Browsers will apply font weight and size styling accordingly.
 <ol> (ordered list): A list of items that must display in a particular order.
Browsers typically apply numbers to each item.
 <ul> (unordered list): A list of items in which order is not important.
Browsers typically apply bullets or dashes to each item.
 <a> (anchor): A hyperlink.
By default, browsers will change the link color to blue and add an underline which you can remove .
 <q> (quote) and <blockquote> : A quotation.
Use <q> for shorter quotes and <blockquote> for longer quotes.
 <code> : Computer code.
Browsers typically apply styling to differentiate this text from the surrounding text.
 <em> (emphasis): Emphasizes text.
Most browsers italicize text inside this tag by default.
 <strong> : Draws attention to important text.
Most browsers bold the text inside this tag by default.
  Semantic HTML Tags for Structure  These HTML tags serve to group child elements into sections.
Each section contains related content.
  <header> : The header of the page.
Headers often contain the organization’s name and logo, primary navigation, a search bar, a sign-in prompt, and/or a shopping cart icon.
 <footer> : The footer of the page.
Footers often contain additional information like an address, a contact form, and/or legal information.
 <main> : Contains the main content of a page.
This is the content that is unique to the specific page, and where visitors will probably spend most of their time.
 <nav> : The site navigation.
This tag usually contains a list of links to different parts of the website.
 <aside> : Contains related content that doesn’t belong with the main content but is still related to it — this might be a related posts list or a sidebar containing display ads.
 <article> : A standalone piece of content, like a blog post or a news article.
 <section> : A section of a longer text piece.
For example, you could assign a different <section> to different h2 s of a blog post.
  Other Semantic HTML Tags   <img> : An image.
 <table> : A table with columns and rows of data.
 <figure> and <figcaption> : Used for images that require a description.
<figure> contains the image itself, and <figcaption> contains the caption associated with the image.
 <iframe> : An embedded element.
  Semantic HTML is well-written HTML.
 When learning a new coding language, especially one as fundamental as HTML, it’s crucial to incorporate best practices into your code as soon as possible.
As you continue to acquire more advanced skills, the habits you form early are more likely to stick.
 Semantic markup is one such practice — it makes your code more readable, more search-engine-friendly, and more accessible to assistive technologies.
Plus, your fellow developers will appreciate your careful attention to detail and adherence to best practices.
 When approaching a web page, consider each element and see if there’s a semantic way to place it, instead of just springing for a <span> or a <div> tag.
It’s well worth the time and effort to get right.

  What Websites Can Use WordPress?
 Why Use WordPress?
 When Did WordPress Start?
 Resources For Building a WordPress Website   What Is WordPress?
 WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS).
It’s a popular tool for individuals without any coding experience who want to build websites and blogs.
The software doesn’t cost anything.
Anyone can install, use, and modify it for free.
     What is WordPress used for?
  In the beginning, WordPress was mainly used to create blogs.
Fast-forward to today, the software has improved, and you can create any type of website you want.
You can build hobby or lifestyle blogs, professional portfolios, business websites, e-commerce stores, mobile applications, and membership sites.
      What Websites Can WordPress Make?
 Hobby or Lifestyle Blogs  Due to WordPress's origin in the blog space, its features for this purpose are rich, including:   The ability to differentiate between posts and pages  A robust WYSIWYG editor for easy post creation  Posts, tags, and categories for creating a rich content organization system  Options for users to leave comments and you to easily moderate them   Once you have WordPress installed, the main thing you'll want to do is choose a theme that appeals to you and what you want to accomplish with your blog.
There are themes that accommodate news, magazine, and tiled layouts (and more).
 Next, you'll want to add plugins for any functionality you want that doesn't come with the theme, such as social sharing buttons or click-to-tweet.
 Professional Portfolios  You can also find a variety of themes for professional portfolios, making WordPress a great choice for showcasing your personal brand.
The "Pages" functionality can be used for your homepage, About page, contact page, etc.
while the "Posts" functionality can be used for the specific pieces you want to highlight — whether they're in image, text, audio, or video format.
 You can choose a theme with a built-in gallery, or you can install plugins for portfolio carousels or sliders .
 Business Websites  A business website needs to get even more mileage out of WordPress, in many cases having more pages and posts than the average personal blog or site and needing additional functionality.
However, due to its powerful built-in CMS capabilities and the open-source community continuing to iterate solutions, WordPress is fantastic at meeting those needs.
 You can choose a website theme that works best for what you're looking to accomplish and then customize it according to your brand.
Page builders such as Elementor and Divi make the layout process even easier.
 With plugins for SEO , lead capture , analytics, and more, you'll be able to integrate and grow your business using WordPress.
 E-Commerce Stores  WordPress is particularly good for creating online stores.
With e-commerce plugins such as WooCommerce, you can manage products, payments, and shipping in the back end while your visitors have an enjoyable shopping experience on the front end.
 Mobile Applications  It can be far more convenient for some users to access your site's features through a mobile app rather than their device's browser.
App development can be costly, but WordPress plugins can turn your site into an app with no hassle.
 Membership Sites  If you're looking to monetize your efforts by restricting premium content to members only, WordPress supports plugins to create membership sites .
You'll be able to manage payments, set up member levels, and monitor signups.

  When Did WordPress Start?
 In 2003, WordPress was created by Matt Mullenweg , a college student at the time.
It started as a relaunch of a previous project called b2/cafelog, originally built by Michel Valdrighi.
Matt saw an opportunity to improve the functionality of a website without modifying its core source code.
And WordPress was born.
 The Importance of WordPress 1.0  Matt developed a new branch of b2 on SourceForge by forking the original concept.
With the help of his friends, he created another version and got the name WordPress.
 Several iterations later, WordPress 1.0 was released to the public in 2004.
It was codenamed “Davis” because Matt admired jazz artists, like Miles Davis.
Similar to the platform today, this version included multiple categories to group your website content and comment moderation.
 The Rise of WordPress  WordPress gained traction after a competitor changed its pricing structure.
Users started looking for alternative solutions, like WordPress.
After quitting his job, Matt started his own company Automattic.
He raised $1.10 million in Series A funding from multiple investors, including True Ventures, Radar Partners, and Polaris Ventures.
 The WordPress of Today  WordPress is now a growing community of developers, designers, and bloggers.
In 2017, WordPress redesigned its user experience with a new editor called Gutenberg .
The latest version, WordPress 5.0 (Bebo), includes a new and improved showcase theme.
Major industries continue to see the value of the platform.

  However, you might not know about comments.
Commented code doesn’t “run” like the rest of your code, but it does make your files much easier to work with.
 Comments in PHP help organize and explain parts of your code that might not be clear to a fellow back-end developer reading it for the first time, or to you after some time away from your code.
They’re also useful for debugging pesky errors, and a good habit to form early when learning to program .
 In this guide, we’ll show you how to use PHP comments to improve your code, including two different ways to write them.
    What are PHP comments?
  In PHP, comments are sections of code that are not executed when a program is run.
End users do not see PHP comments — they are only visible when viewing the PHP code in a file.
PHP comments are usually meant to help programmers understand and interpret the PHP code.
    A PHP comment can explain the purpose of a particular section of code to other programmers.
This way, when a developer is viewing a PHP file for the first time, they can more easily understand the code they’re looking at.
 Similarly, comments help remind programmers why they wrote code in a particular way.
You may create a PHP file, and then not return to it for months or years.
When you eventually re-open the file, you’ll want to have thorough comments so you can quickly familiarize yourself with your old code.
Or, you can use comments to drop short notes to yourself, like where you left off in your work.
 Additionally, PHP comments can be used to temporarily deactivate particular sections of code for debugging purposes.
Say you discover an error originating somewhere in your PHP file — you can “comment out” a part of the code, rerun the program, and see if the error still occurs.
This is much easier (and safer) than deleting lines of code when debugging.
 PHP Comment Syntax  PHP has two built-in ways of commenting: single-line comments and multiline comments.
These are written slightly differently.
 Single-line PHP Comments  Single-line PHP comments are useful for short notes before a code block or for explaining a single line of code.
To leave a single-line comment, type two forward slashes ( // ) followed by your comment text.
All text to the right of the // will be ignored.
You can also use a hash symbol ( # ) instead of // to make a single-line comment.
  <?php
  echo "This message will be printed to the user."; // This is my first output
  echo “This will be also be printed.”; # This is my second output
  // echo “This will not be printed to the user.”;
  # echo “And neither will this.”;
?>  Multiline PHP Comments  PHP also allows for comments that span multiple lines, in case you want to comment out a larger section of code or leave a more descriptive comment.
Start your multiline comment by writing /* and end it by writing */ .
For example:   <?php
  /* This is a multiline PHP
  comment.
None of this
  will be shown to the user.
*/
  echo "This message will be printed to the user.";
?>  PHP comments are a best practice.
 To review, use single-line comments for short notes to clarify the purpose of a function or a line of code, and use multiline comments for longer notes, such as a more detailed description of a code block or a note to a fellow developer that they can delete later.
 In PHP (and other coding languages), comments are often underutilized.
At first, they may seem like an unnecessary step that just adds more bulk to your files.
But, once you start working in teams and taking on complex longer-term projects, you should already be in the habit of writing comments — they’ll save you and others a lot of time trying to figure things out.

Web Developer   Web designers manage the look and feel of your site.
They design the user experience and create an interface that’s aesthetically pleasing and delightful to use.
Web developers, on the other hand, focus on functionality.
They build the frontend and backend of your site so that it operates as intended and provides all of the features needed to be successful.
      What does a web designer do?
 Web designers prioritize your site’s visual appeal and usability.
Their objective is to achieve an aesthetically pleasing design while ensuring a user-friendly experience.
They craft your site’s layout, incorporating elements that drive conversions and ensuring seamless mobile responsiveness across all pages.
 Before working on a site, web designers usually engage with clients to understand their desired site type and features.
With this information, they create an interface and user experience that is intuitive, engaging, and easy to navigate.
 Web designers ensure the effectiveness of their designs through usability tests and gathering feedback from potential users.
They also stay current with the latest website trends and technologies to deliver a modern and distinctive site experience.
 When collaborating with web developers, web designers focus on a site's visual aspects and user experience.
In contrast, web developers handle the site’s structure and overall functionality.
 What does a web developer do?
 Web developers specialize in building websites from scratch, leveraging their technical expertise and proficiency in complex coding techniques and advanced programming languages.
 Unlike web designers who focus on the visual aspects, web developers are responsible for executing the design and bringing creative features to life.
They handle frontend development, coding user-facing elements, as well as backend configurations for servers and databases.
 Their work doesn’t end with the site launch.
Web developers conduct post-launch tests, provide ongoing support, and ensure website maintenance.
This includes addressing any overlooked bugs and ensuring the site functions smoothly.
 Their technical skills and commitment to continuous improvement ensure that your website remains up-to-date and optimized for seamless user experiences.
  Types of Web Designers  It’s extremely important to remember that not all web designers do the same activities.
Most have distinct specializations that limit their focus to only one or two aspects of your website’s design.
 The following are three types of web designers.
  User Experience (UX) Designer  UX designers are in charge of ensuring that users have a pleasant experience when engaging with your website.
They develop layouts and designs based on user feedback and data collected about your target demographic.
 User Interface (UI) Designer  Individual interactions that users have with your site are the focus of UI designers.
They evaluate numerous features of your website and predict how consumers will perceive them while moving through information.
 UI designers are more concerned with the overall look and feel of your site, whereas UX designers make more data-driven judgments.
 Visual Designer  Visual designers are responsible for both the user interface and the user experience.
They ensure that your site has the proper blend of aesthetically pleasing elements and user-friendly functionality.
They help fix design issues and ensure that the website correctly positions the company’s brand.
 Depending on where your website is in the design process, you may need to hire one, two, or all three of these jobs to ensure an appealing and user-friendly design.
  Web Designer Skills  To be a successful web designer, you need the following skills:   Creativity and creative problem-solving.
 Understanding of design principles.
 Photo editing and graphic design skills.
 Communication and customer service.
 Experience with SEO.
 Familiarity with various coding languages.
 Detailed-oriented.
 Interpersonal skills.
 Understanding of marketing and business strategy.
 Project management.
  In addition to these skills, web designers need to know how to use various tools.
Below are some of the most prevalent.
 Web Designer Tools  Here are some tools that web designers use:   Content management system (CMS).
 Graphics editor.
 Screen design tools.
 Project management software.
 Wireframing tools .
 Debugging tools.
 Internal communication software.
 User testing tools .
  Each of these tools has a different provider.
The ones used by web designers will vary depending on the organization they work for, their familiarity with specific technologies, and their project budget.
  Types of Web Developers  Similar to web designers, web developers will also typically have a specialization or a focus.
Here are the most common types.
  Backend Developer  All of your website’s background processes are handled by backend developers.
Databases, server frameworks, and complex programming languages such as PHP, Java, and Ruby are all examples of this.
Their role is to ensure that the site works properly and stays operational over time.
 Frontend Developer  Frontend developers create everything that a user sees when engaging with a website.
They build the visual elements that appear on your pages using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other coding languages.
 Much of their job overlaps with the design team, and they frequently cooperate with designers when developing new features or sections for a website.
 Full-Stack Developer  A full-stack developer can do all of the tasks above.
Depending on where they are needed, they can work on both the frontend and the backend of your website.
They’re essentially a jack-of-all-trades web developer.
 When comparing the differences between a web developer and a web designer, whether you’re researching these careers or looking for the best fit for a project, it’s critical to grasp the various characteristics each function brings to the table.
  Web Developer Skills  Now, let’s look at the abilities required to be a proficient web developer.
  Familiarity with various frontend coding languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
 Familiarity with various backend coding languages like PHP, Java, and Ruby.
 Analytical skills.
 Experience with content management systems (CMS) and ecommerce platforms.
 Communication skills.
 Creative problem solving.
 Experience with APIs.  Project management.
 Interpersonal skills.
 Ability to multitask.
  Mastering all of these talents is part of being a great web developer.
The other aspect is being able to use the tools at your disposal efficiently.
Let’s have a look at some of the most prevalent tools that web developers use on a daily basis.
 Web Developer Tools  Here are the most common tools that web developers use:   Code editors.
 Version control systems.
 Web application frameworks.
 Frontend application frameworks.
 API tools.
 Prototyping tools.
 Project management software.
 Internal communication software.
  It’s worth noting that web developers and designers may use some of the same tools.
With this in mind, it’s a good idea to select a web developer who is also familiar with web designer tools — and vice versa.
  Web Designer vs.
Web Developer Pay  According to Glassdoor , the average compensation for a web designer in 2023 is $57,915 per year, while the average salary for a web developer is $82,615 per year.
 When it comes to calculating how much it will cost to build your site, you have to take into account that designers and developers typically are paid by the hour.
In the United States, the average web designer is paid about $35 , while the average web developer is paid $42.
 So, if your site takes 40 hours to create, this will cost you around $2,000 in total.
Depending on the size and complexity of your site, this estimate may grow or decrease based on the amount of time your designers and developers will devote to the project.
  When to Hire a Web Designer vs.
a Web Developer  Having a web developer and a web designer on your team can help you produce a better website.
To be successful, hiring both isn’t always essential.
 Your individual aims and vision will dictate whether you need a web designer or a web developer (or a combination).
A web designer who can test usability and provide input on layout and design may suffice for basic websites.
A web developer is required to bring your ideas to life for complex websites with advanced functionality.
 Refer to the chart below for instances that can help you decide whether to hire a web designer or a web developer.
  Image Source  Do you need a web designer or a web developer?
 The truth is that it depends.
If you are a do-it-yourself-er and want help making your site look and feel excellent, you should consider hiring a web designer.
 In contrast, if you have an ambitious design that will take a lot of time and work, you should probably engage a developer to oversee the development of your site.
And, in certain circumstances, you’ll want both to ensure that your site looks amazing, operates well, and is done on schedule.
 Each of these roles is crucial to the creation of a site and has unique opportunities to differentiate yours from peers’.
 Consider what you want to do with your site, as well as the information above, while looking for the ideal individual for your company.
Look for someone who understands your goals and can bring your vision to reality.

Embarking on HTML projects for beginners is an excellent way to start.
As someone who once stood where you are now, I can confidently say that the journey from HTML novice to proficiency is both thrilling and immensely rewarding.
It's not just about learning a language; it’s about creating and bringing your ideas to life.
  In my early days of exploring web development, HTML was the cornerstone that laid the foundation for my career.
Now, with several years of experience in web development and a passion for being a resource for beginners, I understand the importance of starting with practical, easy-to-follow projects.
 In this blog, I'm excited to share with you a curated list of HTML projects that are perfect for beginners.

 Before I dive into the exciting world of HTML projects, I want to share why grasping the basics of HTML is crucial.
HTML , which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational building block of the web.
It’s not a programming language, but a markup language that I use to define the structure and layout of a web page through various elements and tags.
 To me, HTML is like creating a framework for web content, similar to how an architect designs a building's blueprint.
You would use tags to mark up text, insert images, create links, and lay out web pages in a format that browsers can understand and display.
These tags , the basic units of HTML, help differentiate between headings, paragraphs, lists, and other content types, giving the web its versatile and user-friendly nature.
  Every web developer starts somewhere, and for many, including myself, that starting point is HTML.
It's a language that empowers me to create, experiment, and develop various digital experiences .
So, as we embark on these beginner projects, remember that you're not just learning a new skill.
You are stepping into a world full of endless possibilities and opportunities.

From creating basic HTML pages to designing dynamic, interactive websites, the skills acquired are just the beginning of a much broader and exciting landscape.
 Embracing New Technologies: The future of web development is tied to the ongoing advancements in technologies.
Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are changing how we build interactive user interfaces.
Meanwhile, advancements in CSS, like Flexbox and Grid, have revolutionized layout design, making it more efficient and responsive.
 Focus on User Experience: As technology progresses, the emphasis on user experience (UX) will become even more crucial.
The success of a website increasingly depends on how well it engages users, provides value, and creates meaningful interactions.
Web developers must continuously learn about the latest UX trends and apply them to their work.
 The Rise of Mobile-First Development: With the increasing use of smartphones for internet access, mobile-first design is no longer an option but a necessity.
This approach involves designing websites for smaller screens first and then scaling up to larger screens, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
 Web Accessibility and Inclusivity: Making the web accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities, is a growing focus.
This includes following best practices and guidelines for web accessibility, ensuring that websites are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
 Performance and Optimization: As users become more demanding about performance, optimizing websites for speed and efficiency will continue to be a priority.
This includes minimizing load times, optimizing images and assets, and writing efficient code.
 Emerging Trends: The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in web development is on the rise, offering new ways to personalize user experiences and automate tasks.
Additionally, the development of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) is blurring the lines between web and mobile apps, offering offline capabilities and improved performance.
 Continuous Learning: The only constant in web development is change.
Continuous learning and adaptation are key to staying relevant in this field.

But without strong personal website examples to guide you, you may not know how to get started or what will work best for your personal branding .
  In this post, we’ll cover the best examples of personal websites we’ve seen — including resume websites, portfolios, blogs, and demo websites.
 Why create a personal website?
 Here's the thing about resumes and cover letters: No matter how unique you try to make your own, for the most part, they tend to read dry.
And there's a good reason for it: It's supposed to be a single, no-frills page that documents your work experience.
And while being concise is good, there's very little opportunity to convey your uniqueness, or for your personality to shine through at all for that matter.

It's both fluid and current.
 In addition, 80% of businesses say a personal website is important when evaluating job candidates.
Recruiters are looking you up online, and a personal website that tells the story you want to tell can make all the difference between you and a competing candidate.
 If you’re considering building a personal website, HubSpot’s drag-and-drop website builder can help you create a website that showcases your individual style and professional accomplishments with ease.
Take a look at the examples below to see some websites that have successfully achieved this.
Are you inspired by a particular style of website?
 Click one of the following links to jump to that section of this article:   Personal Resume Websites  Personal Portfolios  Personal Blogs  Personal Demo Websites      Best Personal Websites    Gary Sheng  Brandon Johnson  Quinton Harris  Sean Halpin  Tony D'Orio  Verena Michelitsch  Gari Cruze  Melanie Daveid  The Beast Is Back  Daniel Grindrod  The Everywhereist  Side Hustle Nation  fifty coffees  Minimalist Baker  Mr. Money Mustache  Albino Tonnina  Robby Leonardi  Samuel Reed  Devon Stank       Personal Resume Websites  Whether you create a single-page site or a larger portfolio, the web resume serves as a more personalized option for sharing information and demonstrating your technological skills — and it can be used by all types of jobseekers.
 Even if you have very little work experience, you can leverage a website to build a better picture of your capabilities and yourself as a candidate, while leaning on your traditional resume to provide the basic background information.
 1.
Gary Sheng   Unlike a standard resume document, Sheng's website makes it easy for him to include logos and clickable links that allow his software engineering and web development skills to shine.
  We love that visitors can choose to scroll down his page to view all of the website's categories ("About Me," "My Passion," etc.), or jump to a specific page using the top navigation.
 The "My System" section reads like a company mission statement, and this personal touch helps humanize his work and make him more memorable.
 2.
Brandon Johnson   Johnson's incredible resume must be seen to be believed.
Beautiful images of planets help to complement his planetary science background, and animations make his resume more of an experience than a document.
 In terms of design, the textured, multi-layered background adds greater depth to the two-dimensional page in a way that evokes feelings of space and the planetary systems, which Johnson's work focuses on.
 3.
Quinton Harris  Harris' resume uses photos to tell his personal story — and it reads kind of like a cool, digital scrapbook.
It covers all the bases of a resume — and then some — by discussing his educational background, work experience, and skills in a highly visual way.
 Not to mention, the copy is fantastic.
It's clear that Harris took the time to carefully choose the right words to describe each step of his personal and professional journey.
 4.
Rubens Cantuni  Rubens Cantuni’s resume website hits all the right notes: First, it showcases what he does with a playful GIF showing the word “CIAO” getting edited point-by-point, just as it would in a design tool.
Second, it summarizes Cantuni’s key strengths in a personable summary.
Third, it lists his experience in a user-friendly collapsible format, so if you want to read more, you can click each individual role.
He then leads into his book and portfolio.
 At every step, you get to appreciate Cantuni’s strong sense of design, user-first thinking, and sharp business acumen.
The designer ends with a call-to-action for visitors to reach out to him.
He also prompts recruiters to inquire about his work by mentioning that he can only share certain pieces of his work privately.
On your own site, you can leverage projects with non-disclosure agreements as “gated content.”  5.
Martine Myrup  Martine Myrup’s website comes up twice on this list — first, as one of the best resume websites, and second, as one of the best portfolio websites we’ve ever seen.
As a practicing artist, Myrup must emphasize visuals in her website’s design.
But she also includes an HTML curriculum vitae for potential employers and other interested parties to see her degrees, exhibitions, awards, and publications.
 The CV is formatted in a way that is clear and easy-to-scan, with bold headings separating each section and dates on the left-hand side.
While artists’ CVs are formatted differently than professional CVs, Myrup’s formatting would work in virtually any field with some adjustments.
 6.
Taylor Vowell  Taylor Vowell’s resume website is an excellent example of how to introduce yourself in a personable way while highlighting your professional experience.
He begins with a summary about his personal life: “I am a father of 3, an avid comic and sports card collector, and a huge Avs and Broncos fan.” That draws readers in immediately and gives them a way to break the ice when they reach out to Vowell.
 Later down the page, he includes his experience in a carousel with cards for each of his employers.
If you’re interested in seeing more of his experience, you can click to the next card, or you can keep scrolling to see his skills in marketing, product design, and technology, as well his strengths and recommendations.
This is a strong resume website that ends with a compelling, eye-catching call-to-action.

Johannes Schüchner  Johannes Schüchner’s film resume website is an example that demonstrates how to showcase your creativity and personality while still highlighting your most important professional achievements.
While the resume is in German, you can still get an understanding of the actor’s key strengths.
 At the bottom, casting directors have an option to download a PDF version of Schüchner’s film credits and theater work.
This website shows that you can tastefully break the rules on your own site, so long as you remain mindful of your target audience.
 8.
José Rocha  José Rocha is a designer who uses delightful parallax effects on his site to engage viewers and visitors.
He introduces himself as a full-stack designer, covers his key strength areas, and then invites readers to scroll through his experience in a concise, interactive section.
 At the top is a transparent navigation bar with his contact information, allowing website visitors to get in contact with him promptly if they want to.
At the bottom is a formal form where people can submit an inquiry.
 9.
Hugo Bazin  Hugo Bazin is a product designer whose resume website combines friendliness with engaging user design.
On the top left-hand corner, he includes a sticky button to download his resume in PDF format, but if you’re interested in getting an overview, you can scroll down to the “Experience” section, where you can see his current and previous employers.
 Throughout the copy, Bazin uses emojis to showcase his personality, but he’s selective.
He keeps emojis out of the “Experience” section of the webpage, where it’s essential to maintain a serious, professional tone.
 10.
Christian Kaisermann  Christian Kaisermann’s resume website employs unique visuals to keep viewers on the page and showcase his strong coding skills.
On the upper right-hand side, you have the option to switch from channel to channel, like you would on an old TV.
He also only includes two paragraphs of copy on the homepage, showing that remaining brief is key if you want visitors to focus on your website’s design.
 On the bottom left-hand corner, users can access Kaisermann’s crawlable HTML resume, email, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You can also activate “Space Mode,” which brings up a remote control to change the channels — very cool!  Best Practices for Resume Websites   Code your resume so it can be crawled by search engines.
 Offer a button to download your resume in PDF so the hiring manager can add it to your file.
 Keep branding consistent between the website and document versions: Use similar fonts, colors, and images so you're easy to recognize.
 Be creative and authentic to yourself.
Think about the colors, images, and media you want to be a part of your story that you couldn't include in a document resume.
   Personal Portfolios  Building an online portfolio is a highly useful personal branding and marketing tool if your work experience and skill set call for content creation.
In fact, photographers, graphic designers, illustrators, writers, and content marketers can all use web portfolios to show off their skills in a more user-friendly way than a resume or hard copy portfolio.
 11.
Seán Halpin  Halpin's portfolio is short, sweet, and to the point, which is authentic to his voice and personal branding outlined on the site.
Instead of a lot of copy, Halpin presents large thumbnail cards so that his projects speak for themselves and allow the user to delve deeper if one catches their eye.
 12.
Tony D'Orio   It's important to keep the design of your visual portfolio simple to let images capture visitors' attention, and D'Orio accomplishes this by featuring bold photographs front-and-center on his website.
His logo and navigation menu are clear and don't distract from his work.
And he makes it easy for potential customers to download his work free of charge.
 Want to give it a try?
Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner, then select + Create a PDF to select as many images as you'd like to download.
 Once you open the PDF, you'll notice that it comes fully equipped with D'Orio's business card as the cover ...
just in case you need it.
  13.
Verena Michelitsch  When you're a designer, not one pixel on your personal website should go unused.
Verena Michelitsch's portfolio, shown above, is covered end to end in artwork.
From her extensive library of work, she chose to exhibit multiple colors, styles, and dimensions so visitors can see just how much range she has as a designer.
It's a perfect example of the classic adage, "show, don't tell."  14.
Gari Cruze   Cruze is a copywriter.
But by turning his website into a portfolio featuring images from different campaigns he's worked on, he makes visitors want to keep clicking to learn more about him.
Also, there's a great CTA at the top of the page that leads visitors to his latest blog post.
 His site's humorous copy — specifically in the "17 Random Things" and "Oh Yes, They're Talking" sections — serves to show off his skills, while making himself more memorable as well.
These pages also include his contact information on the right-hand side, making it easy to reach out and connect at any point:   15.
Melanie Daveid  Daveid's website is a great example of "less is more."  This developer's portfolio features clear, well-branded imagery of campaigns and apps that Daveid worked on, and she shows off her coding skills when you click through to see the specifics of her work.
 While it might seem overly minimal to only include just a few examples of her work, Daveid did her portfolio a service by including her best, most noteworthy campaigns.
At the end of the day, it's better to have fewer examples of excellence in your portfolio than many examples of mediocrity.

The Beast Is Back   Christopher Lee's portfolio is busy and colorful in a way that works.
When you read more about Lee on his easily navigable site, you realize that such a fun and vibrant homepage is perfect for an illustrator and toy designer.
 Known by his brand name, "The Beast Is Back," Lee's web portfolio highlights eye-catching designs with recognizable brands, such as Target and Mario, along with links to purchase his work.
This is another gallery-style portfolio with pops of color that make it fun and give it personality, thus making it more memorable.
 17.
Daniel Grindrod  This freelance videographer is another example of a simple but sleek portfolio, allowing his potential clients to browse deeper into his "Work" and "Stills" sections.
The opening video on the homepage — as shown on the still image above — also ensures his site visitors know that he's actively creating beautiful work.
 18.
Byron McNally  In his portfolio, Byron McNally doesn’t immediately include his work but rather a photo of himself, which immediately fosters a connection between him and website visitors.
This minimal website design also invites users to continue engaging with the website’s content and see some of his recent film, commercial, and music productions.
 19.
Martine Myrup  Martine Myrup was also in our list of best resume websites, but her portfolio is worth a mention, too.
With its muted colors and creative use of typography, it immediately conveys her artistic vision and aesthetic.
The page also includes a sticky bright green button prompting you to check out her CV.
As you scroll down the page, you can see a preview of her work and click on the one that most interests you, then get in contact with her using the email at the bottom.
 20.
Davide Perozzi  Davide Perozzi uses his website to showcase his strong design skills and creative typography, as well as his previous work.
When you hover over each item in his portfolio, an image preview pops up, giving you the opportunity to check out more.
The website uses scrolling effects and bold text to keep viewers engaged.
 Best Practices for Portfolio Websites   Use mainly visuals.
Even if you're showcasing your written work, using logos or other branding is more eye-catching for your visitors.
 Don't be afraid to be yourself.
Your personality, style, and sense of humor could be what sets you apart from other sites!  Organization is key.
If your portfolio is full of photos, logos, and other images, make sure it's easy for visitors to navigate to where they can contact you.
 Brand yourself.
Choose a logo or icon to make your information easily identifiable.
   Personal Blogs  Consistently publishing on a blog is a great way to attract attention on social media and search engines — and drive traffic to your site.
Blogging is a smart way to give your work a personality, chronicle your experiences, and stretch your writing muscles.
You might write a personal blog if you're a writer by trade, but virtually anyone can benefit from adding a blog to their site and providing useful content for their audience.
 21.
The Everywhereist   This blog looks a bit busier, but its consistent branding helps visitors easily navigate the site.
The travel blog uses globe iconography to move visitors around the site, making it easy to explore sections beyond the blog.
 Owned by writer Geraldine DeRuiter, this blog also features a "Best Of" section that allows new visitors to learn about what the blog covers to get acclimated.
The color scheme is warm, neutral, and free of excess clutter that could distract from the content.
 22.
Side Hustle Nation   Side Hustle Nation is the business blog of Nick Loper, an advisor whose website offers tons of valuable financial advice for individual business owners.
His homepage, shown above, sets a lighthearted yet passionate tone for his readers.
It suggests you'll get friendly content all committed to a single goal: financial freedom.
The green call to action, "Start Here," helps first-time visitors know exactly how to navigate his website.
 On Nick's blog page, you'll see content that shows readers how Nick, himself, creates content that helps his business grow.
These content types give people a peek behind the curtain of your operation, showing them you practice what you preach and that your insight is tried and true.
 23.
fifty coffees  The website fifty coffees chronicles the author's series of coffee meetings in search of her next job opportunity, and it does a great job of using photography and visuals to assist in the telling of her lengthy stories.
 The best part?
Each post ends with numbered takeaways from her meetings for ease of reading comprehension.
The high-quality photography used to complement the stories is like icing on the cake.
 24.
Minimalist Baker  I'm not highlighting Dana's food blog just because the food looks delicious and I'm hungry.
Her blog uses a simple white background to let her food photography pop, unique branding to make her memorable, and mini-bio to personalize her website.
 25.
Mr. Money Mustache  Mr. Money Mustache might take on an old-school, Gangs of New York-style facade, but his blog design — and the advice the blog offers — couldn't be more fresh (he also doesn't really look like that).
 This financial blog is a funny, browsable website that offers sound insight into money management for the layperson.
While his personal stories help support the legitimacy of his advice, the navigation links surrounding his logo make it easy to jump right into his content without any prior context around his brand.

Marco Feng  Marco Feng’s travel blog is colorful, unique, and informative.
When you arrive at the site, you can immediately jump in to the blog post that draws your attention the most, or explore by destination.
Our favorite part of the site is the scrolling banner at the top that provides social proof: As a reader, you’d be joining 3 million others.
Leveraging your audience size will help you look more authoritative and establish your site as a go-to.
 27.
Miramono  Miramono is a unique photography blog created by Fernando Puente , where he curates a “selection of photographers he deeeeply loves.” In it, he includes interviews, essays, and photo selections.
At the bottom is an eye-catching graphic prompting viewers to subscribe.
We love the simplicity of the website’s design, as well as its unique value proposition.
 28.
Beamaker  This blog combines engaging visual design with user-friendliness.
Since Japanese is written vertically, the home page includes a series of vertical cards, each for a different blog post.
You can then click on each card to expand a specific post.
The writer divides his musings into three categories: Make, Think, and Jumble.
He discusses his personal life at home as well as his life at work, epitomizing what a personal blog should contain.
 29.
Salt in Our Hair  Salt in Our Hair is a travel blog with exceptional user design.
The bloggers, Nick and Hannah, introduce themselves on the welcome screen.
Users then have the option of choosing a specific destination to read about or finding a specific topic using the menu up top.
 30.
Daniel See  Daniel See uses the blog section of his website to share his thoughts on design.
As a designer, he uses his subject-matter expertise to write blog posts about creative processes.
He also prompts readers to submit their feedback and ideas by including a button to “let him know your thoughts.”  Best Practices for Blogs   Keep your site simple and clutter-free to avoid additional distractions beyond blog posts.
 Publish often.
Those who prioritize marketing efforts are 13x more likely to see positive ROI .
 Experiment with different blog styles, such as lists, interviews, graphics, and bullets.
 Employ visuals to break up text and add context to your discussion.
   Personal Demo Websites  Another cool way to promote yourself and your skills is to create a personal website that doubles as a demonstration of your coding, design, illustration, or developer skills.
These sites can be interactive and animated in a way that provides information about you and also shows hiring managers why they should work with you.
This is a great website option for technical and artistic content creators such as developers, animators, UX designers, website content managers, and illustrators.
 31.
Albino Tonnina  Tonnina is showcasing advanced and complicated web development skills, but the images and storytelling methods he uses are simple and easy to understand.
In the process, you get a demo of the depth of his animation and coding experience.
 32.
Robby Leonardi  Leonardi's incredible demo website uses animation and web development skills to turn his portfolio and resume into a video game for site visitors.
The whimsical branding and unique way of sharing information ensure that his site is memorable to visitors.
 33.
Samuel Reed  Reed uses his page as a start-to-finish demo of how to code a website.
His website starts as a blank white page and ends as a fully interactive site that visitors can watch him code themselves.
The cool factor makes this website memorable, and it makes his skills extremely marketable.
 34.
Renaud Rohlinger  Renaud Rohlinger’s demo site does a great job of showing his 3D design chops, and it takes it a step further by telling visitors all about him and his passions.
It's the perfect balance of a demo and a mini-portfolio.
 Plus, we love the video he includes as the background, as well as the parallax effects that activate as you scroll down the page.
 35.
Enric Moreu  Enric Moreu showcases his 3D design skills by creating an interactive 3D resume.
As users scroll, the page smoothly takes them through Moreu’s spoken languages, coding languages, skills, and work experiences.
It’s engaging, light on text, and visually striking.
 36.
Mariah Weathersby  Mariah Weathersby has coded a striking “playable” resume that pays homage to old-school games and showcases her strong design skills.
If you love experiencing nostalgia, this demo website will reel you in.
If you only want the resume, you have the option of downloading a text-based version — a win-win.
 37.
Isaac Fayemi  Isaac Fayemi’s demo website is subtle and striking at the same time.
Rather than loading the page with excessive graphics, he has created a 3D version of his head that follows your cursor as you move around.
You have two options: To find out more about him or check out more of his work.
This demo website is a stellar example of how to keep it simple while still delighting the senses.
 Best Practices for Demo Websites   Brand yourself and use consistent logos and colors to identify your name and your skills amongst the bevy of visuals.
 Don't overwhelm your visitors with too many visuals at once — especially if your demo is animated.
Be sure to keep imagery easy to understand so visitors aren't bombarded when they visit your site.
  Developing a Personal Website  Regardless of the type of personal website you're building, there's plenty of inspiration above on how to convey personality while connecting with your audience.
Keeping the above tips in mind, remember to design for your audience's experience, and most importantly, have fun.

But what makes a resume “great”?
How do you catch recruiters’ attention, encourage them to read your resume, and ultimately call you for an interview?
  Two words: Simple and effective.
  In this piece, we’ll offer a step-by-step guide to writing a simple, effective resume .
Then, we’ll showcase 20 examples of what this looks like in practice.
Ready to level up your resume-writing technique?
Let’s get started.
 Table of Contents   How to Write a Simple Resume  20 Simple Resume Examples    How to Write a Simple Resume  While resume specifics vary depending on the type of job you’re looking for and the experience required, there are seven steps that apply in any circumstance to help your resume stand out.
 1.
Pick a format.
 Before you start writing, pick a format that suits both your personal style and works for the position being offered.
 For example, if you’re applying for a graphic design position, it may be worth including images on your resume that help highlight your skills.
 If the job you’re after is a highly technical engineering role, meanwhile, you may want something more straightforward.
 Regardless of the format you choose, the goal is simplicity.
Don’t clutter the resume with extraneous information or conflicting colors.
Instead, let your experience and interest speak for themselves.
 2.
Start with your contact information.
 No surprise here — prospective employers need to know how they can contact you.
Despite the necessity of this contact data, however, it’s not uncommon to see it missed on resumes or left until the bottom of the page.
 Best bet?
Put your details — including name, phone number, and email address — at the top of the page as a header.
 3.
Include an overview.
 Next is an overview of your professional profile.
This may include details about your current position along with any titles or degrees you hold.
 Depending on the role, you may also want to include links to digital portfolios or work you’ve published online.
 4.
List your education and experience.
 Education and experience are up next.
 This should be a simple list of your educational history, including any degrees or certificates you’ve earned and when you earned them, followed by a list of your previous work experience.
 Bullet points work well here: Each bullet point represents a different job and includes details such as job title, responsibilities, and how long you were employed.
 5.
Speak to your skills.
 Now it’s time to talk about your skills as they relate to the job being offered.
 Wherever possible, use keywords from the job advertisement itself.
This is because many companies now use automated resume analysis and tracking systems that may prioritize these keywords.
 6.
Highlight any relevant certifications.
 Make sure to mention any relevant qualifications or certifications.
 For example, if you’re applying with an IT security firm, you could highlight certifications such as CompTIA Security+ or Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) qualification.
 7.
Add any relevant details.
 Finally, add any other details that are relevant to the job, such as volunteer experience in a related field or any professional accolades for your work.
  20 Simple Resume Examples  Simple, effective resumes offer the best chance of getting noticed, but there’s no one-size-fits-all template when it comes to design.
 Here are 20 simple resume examples .
 1.
Modern Initials (Word)   The first four templates on our list are all from Microsoft Word.
 To access these templates, open Word, select New from the left-hand sidebar, and then type “resume” into the search box that appears.
Word will bring up a host of resume template options for you to download and use.
 Modern is one of the first templates listed and offers a clean and simple format for all of your details.
The minimalist design means that your information stands out.
 What we like:  Simplicity is the focus of this template.
Every section is clearly marked, and there’s no hunting for data.
 2.
Bold Modern (Word)   This Word template is similar to the example above but with the addition of a sidebar for profile and contact information.
It also comes with increased emphasis on your skill set.
 What we like: Bold Modern puts you and your skills front and center, which is a great fit for jobs that prioritize real-world experience over specific certifications.
 3.
Crisp and Clean (Word)   Crisp and clean is a great description of this template.
Unlike Bold Modern, there are no images — instead, one box of color is used to highlight your objective.
 What we like:  Using boxes, this template thinks a bit outside the box with a non-standard setup for information.
 4.
Creative (Word)   The Creative template from Word trends back toward the simple but brings your experience to the forefront.
 It effectively divides your personal and professional lives into two columns, which can be a boon for recruiters looking for specific data.
 What we like: It’s easy to find what you’re looking for in this template, making it a great choice for a simple, effective resume.
 5.
Spearmint (Google Docs)   The next five examples on our list come from Google Docs.
To access these templates, head to Google Docs and then select Template Galley in the upper right-hand corner.
 First on our list of Docs templates is Spearmint, presumably named for its green accent color.
This template isn’t pushing any boundaries but offers a solid starting point for simple resumes.
 What we like:  Spearmint reads well.
A quick scan of the resume gives HR teams exactly what they need: an overview of your skills, experience, and education.
 6.
Swiss (Google Docs)   The Swiss template from Google Docs offers a minimalist approach to resume data by separating headings from information.
 What we like:  Because the headings are separate, hiring teams don’t need to scan the entire document for what they want.
Instead, they can simply find the heading they want and move straight across.
 7.
Modern Writer (Google Docs)   This template is a great fit if you’re applying for writing or publishing jobs.
A cute touch is that the font used looks similar to that of a typewriter.
 What we like: The unique font helps this example stand out from the crowd.
Worth noting?
Fonts are best used sparingly.
Go too far into left field — say with Comic Sans — and your resume may not have the intended effect.
 8.
Coral (Google Docs)   Coral is similar to Modern Writer but with a more familiar font.
There’s nothing flashy about this example, which is why it works: All relevant data is presented in an easy-to-see and easy-to-read format.
 What we like:  The “Hello, I’m…” detail at the top offers a slightly different take on the common resume introduction, which can help you get noticed.
 9.
Serif (Google Docs)   Serif splits up your data into two columns, with skills and awards on one side and education and experience on the other.
It’s a simple way to highlight what you offer while keeping your resume easy to read.
 What we like:  Finding information on this resume is quick and easy, which is ideal considering the number of resumes teams often have to review.
 10.
Infographic (Venngage)   This Venngage template takes a wildly different approach to resumes by using an infographic format that relies on graphics rather than text.
It’s a great way to quickly capture attention.
 What we like: The rating bubbles for skills showcase not only ability but proficiency, which could help get you noticed.
 11.
Streamlined Infographic (Venngage)   Another infographic example from Venngage, this template splits the resume in two with graphics at the top and text at the bottom, plus a photo in the middle.
 What we like:  By using graphic skill depictions on the top half of the resume and explanatory text on the bottom, it’s easy to get a general sense of the applicant’s capabilities and skills.
 12.
Data Focused Infographic (Venngage)   This infographic is all about skills, education, and experience data.
 By using a combination of skill and timelines paired with simple graphics, this resume manages to communicate a substantial amount of data without becoming too complex.
 What we like:  The three-block design used is a great way to break up resume text into manageable pieces.
 13.
Chronological (Resume Builder)   This example from Resume Builder focuses on chronological work experience.
Then, it follows up with key skills and education.
 What we like: Chronological resumes are a great way to show the progression of job responsibilities and promotions over time.
 14.
Functional (Resume Builder)   This example digs into professional experience with detailed descriptions of job responsibilities and roles.
While the experience section remains chronological, the focus isn’t on time, so much as effort.
 What we like:  By highlighting the role and responsibilities of each previous job, this resume helps applicants build a case for why they should be considered.
 15.
Targeted (Resume Builder)   Our last Resume Builder example is designed to target a specific role.
While all the familiar sections remain, each includes information that speaks to the applicant’s ability to excel if hired.
 What we like:  Creating a targeted resume can help get you noticed because it means you’ve taken the time to read and review exactly what the company is looking for in their new hire.
 16.
Cubic (Zety)   Cubic opts for a three-toned greyscale approach that separates each section.
This makes it easy for recruiters to zero in on what matters rather than having to search your resume for specific data.
 What we like:  The bold background used for the header puts your name and contact information front and center.
 17.
Primo (Zety)   Primo uses a right-hand sidebar with star ratings to show off your skills, coupled with a timeline of work experience in the main body.
 What we like:  This resume changes up the standard format just enough to be interesting, but not so much that recruiters are left frustrated trying to find relevant information.
 18.
Cascade (Zety)   Cascade goes in the opposite direction to Primo with a left-hand sidebar and a right-side section that contains more detailed information.
 What we like:  The bold, left-hand sidebar is great for short descriptions of skills that are relevant to your new potential role.
 19.
Concept (Zety)   Concept is a great choice if you have education and skills but lack more in-depth work experience.
The solid-colored sidebar works well as a timeline background, which helps give the resume a sense of momentum.
 What we like:  Even without a lot of work experience, you could still be a great fit for a new role.
This template helps showcase the complete picture of your skills and abilities.
 20.
Crisp (Zety)   Crisp offers simplicity in black-and-white.
Rounded icons and rating scales save this template from being all text, but don’t detract from your achievements and experience.
 What we like:  This is a great example of simple and effective without being boring.
All the relevant data is here, but it’s not just a wall of text.
 The Simple Resume: Basic But Not Boring  Simple, effective resumes help you get noticed by making it easier for HR teams and recruiters to find the information they need and make a decision.
 But simple doesn’t mean boring.
While there’s no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to building your resume, the templates listed above can help your resume stand out for all the right reasons.

Everything You Need to Know   Jul 26, 2023                       15 Stunning Examples of Small Business Website Design    Visit HubSpot's Website Theme Marketplace        Jamie Juviler     Updated: October 13, 2022   Published: June 28, 2021       If you’re a small business, your website has a big impact on your success.
Research shows that roughly a third of people use the web to find local businesses .
Honestly, I’m surprised that number isn’t higher.
  As a small business, you might not have the budget to hire a designer, bring in a development team, or pay for a suite of design tools for your new site.
A basic brochure site will probably have to do for now, right?
 But here’s the thing: You don’t need a design portfolio or a branding team to make an effective website.
A lot of what makes websites work boils down to clear and intuitive navigation, well-written copy, and tasteful use of color , typography , and images — no design degree necessary.
 Still, it’s one thing to talk about good design, and another to actually build a website that delivers on all design fronts .
Lucky for us, there are many fascinating websites that have figured out what works.
So, for help in your design journey, we’ve compiled our favorite examples of excellent small business websites to inspire your own.
  Small Business Website Design Examples  There are, of course, thousands of small business websites you can draw from, but we think these 15 serve as a good starting point whether you’re planning a redesign or wireframing your first iteration.
By the way, these are all real businesses, so you can click each link to explore the website yourself.
Let’s dive in.
  1.
Bennett Tea  Starting off our list is a gorgeous example of what you can accomplish with color palettes, animated page transitions, scrolling effects, and creative layouts.
The Bennett Tea shop offers just a handful of premium tea options, but each is presented elegantly through this online store’s unconventional format.
 Typically, stores display their products as grids with links to product pages.
On the Bennett Tea website, however, users scroll down to explore each offering, with a life-sized image of the tea box and descriptions of the taste, aroma, and mouthfeel.
It’s the perfect visual palette to complement the company’s variety of tastes.
 Also notable is the site’s navigation experience.
Upon landing on the website, visitors are shown a splash page stating the company’s mission.
They then have the option to continue to the store or go to the About or Contact pages.
It may require one additional click to get to the store page, but this choice puts the branding front and center for potential customers.
  2.
Aroz Jewelry  Belgium-based jeweler Aroz has constructed an immaculate website to showcase and sell their items.
Offering a variety of accessories, Aroz first greets visitors with a full-width image, below which they present their pieces in a grid slider.
 As users continue scrolling, the website makes frequent use of zoom-in animation, slide-in animation, and fade-in effects for greater visual impact.
Each text section establishes the store’s offerings, capped off with a contact form and a social media CTA.
 For those looking to learn more about Aroz, the website also includes a blog featuring new collections as well as customer and designer stories.
All of these components work to conjure a professional, sophisticated, and unique brand image — a great example of what an ecommerce site can be.
  3.
Chicago French Press  If a tea shop can have a fantastic website, why not a coffee roaster?
Chicago French Press sells a variety of rotating flavors while donating a portion of its proceeds to nonprofits and charitable organizations.
 Like Bennett Tea, this website emphasizes the aesthetics of the product packaging.
It also implements color backgrounds to distinguish between flavors, as seen in the full-width image slider on the homepage.
 The Chicago French Press store is easy to navigate, as visitors can search by different criteria including flavor, brewing method, and bag size.
And, if you want to incorporate their flavors with food, the website’s blog includes recipe posts too.
  4.
Wildwood Bakery  Wildwood Bakery’s website incorporates illustrations in small but stunning ways.
The Australian bakery has made a simple but captivating website with little more than some delicate illustrations, a nice orange-and-green color palette, and mouth-watering close-ups of their creations.
 On the homepage, visitors can learn about the bakery and click away to the website’s online store or sourdough subscription service.
The bottom of the page sports a footer with social links and other useful resources.
Note that the footer is more prominent than usual — the large text draws the eye to other important aspects of the business like sustainability and wholesale.
 Wildwood’s store page is also worth checking out.
Customers can filter products by flavors and quickly add anything to the cart.
It’s clear that the designers considered everything, as even the cart icon is a custom illustration.
It’s these details that make this site exceptional.
  5.
AÃRK Collective  The website for watchmaker AÃRK Collective leaves no question as to what it does — from the start, its timepieces are displayed in full-page, aesthetically pleasing images.
The whole thing resembles more of a gallery than an ecommerce site and establishes the brand's commitment to simple and elegant designs.
 But, this is ultimately an online store, and scrolling down reveals AÃRK’s product lines in a masonry grid style .
The presentation is quite minimal, but this lets visitors focus solely on the designs themselves.
There’s no other information until you click on an item, which sends you to a product page with all the relevant information, plus many more images to be sure you’re making the right watch purchase.
  6.
Cleenland  Not all websites have to be visually elaborate — this is proven with Cleenland’s online store.
The Boston-based company sells low-waste home care and personal hygiene products, and the site wastes no time nudging visitors to visit the physical location.
 Visitors can also shop online in Cleenland’s online store, which lists its product categories with images of each product and information about the supplier.
This way, you know products are sourced sustainably.
There’s even a “popular products” category serving up the best this store has to offer.
  7.
Ladies Get Paid  Ladies Get Paid is a membership website that offers financial and professional education courses for women.
There are online classes, speaker events, and networking events, as well as job postings and online communities, all to fuel career advancement and financial confidence.
 From a visual perspective, Ladies Get Paid does a fantastic job of presenting its variety of benefits in a straightforward manner.
Its mission is clear from the start, and the page header lets guests view each offering in more detail.
 The website also effectively incorporates hints of color in its interactive items .
Its cards and buttons match each other for a cohesive feel and incorporate subtle hover effects for a pleasing user experience.
Overall, the website is bold but inviting, a difficult but certainly achievable balance.
  8.
Good Vibes All Purpose Cleaner  Maybe I’m just biased toward sustainable cleaning products, but Good Vibes All Purpose Cleaner presents a simple, effective ecommerce site that manages to convey its philosophy and offerings seamlessly.
 Good Vibes has no frill with its product displays — products are shown in a grid format as you might expect.
However, the website also prominently features reviews and testimonials from customers below to instill confidence in new buyers.
 Each product page includes a description as well as cleaning instructions, ingredients, reviews, and recommended products.
It’s enough to make a positive impression without relying on visual gimmicks.
  9.
Wisr  I never expected to have this much fun on a financial services website, but here we are — Wisr offers personal loans, financial planning, and, above all, an incredibly amusing homepage.
As you scroll, you follow the path of a simulated marble course from start to end.
With each obstacle, you learn more about what Wisr does.
 Whether you think this design choice serves as a metaphor for the often unpredictable financial road ahead, or just a cool thing to look at, this website definitely stands out among the rest.
 As another cool secondary feature, the website remembers what page you exit from.
So, upon a return visit, you’ll see a prompt inviting you back to the page where you left off.
It’s a clever use of cookies that can help get prospects back on the conversion path.
  10.
Cafe con Libros  Intersectional Feminist bookstore Cafe con Libros (Coffee with Books) not only offers espressos with your purchase — it also boasts a fantastic website with everything you need under one domain name.
 This site manages to pack its book inventory, merch store, event calendar, and mission onto the homepage alone without overcomplicating things.
Visitors can also order any book from the store — physical, e-book, or audiobook — for pickup or delivery through the site.
 As if that weren’t enough, the website also maintains an active blog with reflections and book reviews, a newsletter, a monthly book subscription service, and a podcast with an on-site player.
It’s an excellent balance of quantity of offerings with quality of design.
  11.
Reform Collective  Design agency Reform collective features one of the most cinematic scrolling experiences I’ve seen on a website.
It combines fixed scrolling with horizontal scrolling to showcase each section in chunks while keeping visitors on the same page.
 Each individual section mentions some piece of the company, be it their design style and philosophy, a case study, testimonials, or a contact form.
If you’re looking for a long-scrolling website that presents information to visitors in a specific linear sequence, try emulating this trick — it ensures users see what you want them to and in what order.
  12.
Sweet Dreams  Sweet Dreams may create CBD and melatonin products for better rest, but don’t sleep on this website.
Combining 2D and 3D illustrations, scrolling animation effects, customer reviews, and even interactive graphics, the homepage for this small business does a great job getting visitors in the mindset of their product before promoting the products themselves.
 Informational sections are interspersed with product links so that new customers, whether sold or skeptical, know what they’re buying and how these products work.
To learn more, the About page includes masterful visuals and copy to put visitors at ease.
Given what they’re selling, that seems like the right approach.
  13.
Panache  The graphic design and branding experts and Panache have proven their abilities with their one-page informational website.
This is another example of how scrolling can be much more than a way to traverse the page — here, it triggers colorful transitions and animations that leave a strong impression.
 Panache makes this list because, rather than including a separate gallery for showcasing the work, it blends its aesthetic approach into the construction of the site itself.
This ultimately gets potential clients down to the contact form more quickly.
There are also navigational links along the left side of the page in case visitors wish to return to a particular section.
  14.
Scott's Cheap Flights  The goal of Scott’s Cheap Flights is to help U.S. travelers easily and cheaply book vacations to domestic and international destinations.
Its membership website is suitably simple: Just sign up and start getting daily emails with the latest discounted flight offerings.
 Once signed in, the website places its offers front-and-center — each one occupies a card with a colorful image of the destination.
Clicking a card takes you to a page with information about the destination, instructions on how to book, and ticket prices by airport.
Some cards are premium, and the “Upgrade” button lingers in the top right tempting users to subscribe.
 Additionally, this website also provides a ton of extra value to free and premium users in its blog section.
In it, there are tips for booking flights, travel advice, and guides for exploring new cities.
  15.
Music Audience Exchange  Finally, Music Audience Exchange (MAX) creates partnerships between brands and musical artists for promotional purposes, with a website that conveys class and professionalism.
 Since it caters to both artists and companies, it features two pages for both types of clients, with step-by-step guides explaining how the process works.
It’s an efficient means to channel both brands and musicians alike toward an application form and a conversion.
  Big Design Ideas for Small Businesses  Designing a website is, without a doubt, a challenge for small businesses.
But after some perusing, you can come up with a list of your favorite inspiration sites and what makes them pop, then incorporate these features into your own site.
Plus, you probably spend a good deal of time on sleek sites already and have a good sense of what you’ll want.

But to get that increased traffic, you need the best blogging platform for your needs and goals.
 Publishing blog content offers many benefits .
Blogging can help you establish authority in an industry.
It can drive brand awareness, share company news, and better convert website traffic into leads.
  But the wrong platform can also limit your returns.
It can restrict your ability to gather leads, improve SEO, monetize your blog, and more.
 There are many great choices for blogs that come at little or no cost, with a ton of valuable features that can bring you results for your efforts.
To find the best platform for your new blog, keep reading or jump to the section you’re looking for.
  What is the best blogging platform for you?
 How to Choose a Blogging Platform  Finding the Best Blogging Platform for SEO  Best Blogging Platforms    What is the best blogging platform for you?
 Building a blog takes time and dedication.
It's a long-term investment, and that includes the platform you use to create it.
 This means that no matter how great a blog platform is, it needs to be right for you.
It's challenging to move a blog to a new site after it gets going, so the better you prepare before you start blogging, the more likely you are to have lasting results.
 So, before we cover the most popular choices, let's talk about what you need in a platform for your blog.
 If you're just starting out , you'll want a platform that's easy to set up and use.
If you don't have coding experience, it's important to find a platform for your blog that doesn't need you to code.
Developing a blog isn't simple, and you'll have more than enough to do without adding new skills to your to-do list.
  Next, you'll want to do some big-picture thinking about the type of blog you want to make.
This means drawing inspiration from the blogs you admire.
It's a good idea to create a list of layouts and features you like, and take note of blog tools you may need as your blog grows.
 Below are a few questions you'll want to ask yourself to prepare:   Do you plan to monetize your blog with a newsletter now or in the future?
 Is a multimedia experience with lots of images and videos your goal?
 Are you starting a blog to build SEO for your small business site?
 Or are you hoping it can build your reputation as a thought leader?
 What skills do you need to learn to build your blog?
 How many of those skills can a blogging platform help with?
  Once you have a clear plan for your blog, you're ready to choose the best blogging platform for you.
  How to Choose a Blogging Platform  For many, choosing a blog platform starts with cost.
Some of the best blog software is free.
So, check what plans each provider offers and how many tiers there are.
Then look into their primary and unique features.
Pay special attention to the value that out-of-the-box features offer in comparison to add-ons.
  Start blogging with HubSpot's Content Management System.
 But what you're willing and able to pay is just the first of many important decisions.
Let's take a look at some other features you might need for your blog.
This can help you compare different blogging platforms.
 Themes and Templates  Themes and templates allow you to customize a blog quickly and easily.
When looking at different blogging platforms, check out their selection of themes and templates.
  Ask yourself:   Do they have a lot of templates for blogging specifically?
 Do they have a variety of free and premium templates and themes?
 Can you edit the themes and templates to create a truly customized look for your site?
 Do you want to create your blog from scratch instead of a predesigned theme?
  These are just a few questions that can help you choose a platform with the design and customization options you need.
 There's also a strong chance that you'll fall in love with a blog theme and want to start building your blog right away.
But if you're blogging for your business, it's about more than aesthetics.
 Content Editor  The content editor is the core of every blogging platform.
As a blogger, you might be working with this editor every day, so make sure you pick a platform with an editor you like.
 Think about ease of use.
You want to be able to set up a blog and start adding content to it quickly.
And you should be able to get a sense of the functionality and flexibility of the tool.
 To test this, you may want to create a complex blog draft.
Be sure to add internal links, videos, and different images.
Anything you think you might want to include in your final blog should be ready to test on each platform.
 As you start comparing platforms you'll start to get stuck on specific details.
It can help to break your list of desired features into must-haves and nice-to-haves.
 For example, maybe your editor must have drag-and-drop functionality and an auto-save feature.
But it'd be nice to have the option to preview how your post looks on different devices.
  Finding the Best Blogging Platform for SEO  Another important factor is how a blogging platform's capabilities align with your goals and needs.
For example, if you need to boost your visibility in SERPs, you'll need a platform with built-in SEO tools.
 Optimizing your content for search is essential to driving traffic to your blog.
According to a Backlinko study, sites listed on the first SERP in Google get 27% of all clicks for a keyword or phrase.
 It's well-established that blogging can improve SEO if it's a useful resource for your customers.
But SEO takes time to learn if you're just beginning your content marketing journey.
 On-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO are all important strategies that take time and effort to learn.
 SEO Features and Tools  So, to get on that first page, you ideally want a platform with built-in tools to help you optimize your content.
 Many blogging platforms offer plugins or add-ons to help with SEO.
But the features that will be most useful to you will depend on your current know-how.
For example, some platforms can help you build a site map or manage your blog URLs.  Many SEO techniques are repetitive processes full of details.
So, it's also ideal to have a platform for your blog that can remind you to optimize for search as you build each blog.
For example, HubSpot SEO software offers on-page tips like reminding you to add alt text to blog images.
  If a platform doesn't have this type of advanced functionality, then check if you can install a third-party SEO tool.
Otherwise, you'll have to get up to speed on SEO best practices and make sure to add them to your blog.
 Extensions and Integrations  No blogging platform can offer every single feature every single blogger wants out of the box.
Besides, your blogging needs and goals will likely change over time as your audience grows or strategy shifts.
 That's why it's important to choose a blogging platform that offers extensions or integrations with third-party tools.
Platforms with an ecosystem of apps will be able to scale with you over time.
This helps make sure that you don't have to migrate to a more flexible alternative in the future.
  Now that you know some features to consider in your selection process, let's take a look at some of the best blogging platforms on the market.
   Best Blogging Platforms    Content Hub  WordPress  Squarespace  Wix  Pixpa  Craft CMS  Contently  Joomla  Hostinger  btw  Drupal  LinkedIn  Write.as  Blogger  Medium  Tumblr      1.
Content Hub  Best For: Content Marketers   Blog Software Cost: Free, With Premium Options  Content Hub Ideal Users  What sets Content Hub apart from other blogging platforms is that it seamlessly integrates with the rest of HubSpot's CRM platform, making it ideal for business bloggers.
It has the tools, technologies, and workflows you need to create and distribute your blog content.
At the same time, it offers a great user experience with easy access to features that drive conversions.
 Furthermore, Content Hub has AI capabilities baked right into the platform.
For example, you can leverage the Free AI Blog Writer to create blog posts.
 Content Hub Pros  The biggest advantage of this free blog software is that it's powerful but still easy to use.
You can start by choosing a pre-designed theme or building your own custom theme with the drag-and-drop website builder .
Content Hub includes free web hosting and it's easy to connect a custom domain .
 Then, using HubSpot's blog editor and built-in SEO tools, you can create blog posts with CTAs, forms, and other interactive elements.
 You can even create multi-language variations of your blog posts and run A/B tests on them to reach a global audience.
Before you publish, you can preview how your posts and pages look on different types of devices.
 Once you're ready to start promoting, you can connect your blog to your social media accounts.
That way, you can automatically share new blog posts on your social networks in the same place that you wrote them.
 As you publish more content, you can analyze your blog performance.
This can help you understand what topics and types of content are resonating with your readers.
That's because Content Hub is part of HubSpot's CRM platform.
 Content Hub Cons  Since Content Hub is an all-in-one solution for marketers and developers, it has lots of rich functionality and a ton of attractive themes.
This is a good thing for most bloggers and G2 gives HubSpot a 4.5/5 rating with almost 1400 reviews.
 But, if you're an individual or small business just starting to blog, then you may not have the time or expertise to leverage the full power of the Content Hub.

 WordPress  Best For: Themes and Plugins   Blog Software Cost: Free, With Premium Options  WordPress Ideal Users  Creating and managing a blog on WordPress could mean more maintenance than other platforms, but it will offer the extensibility and content management features publishers and other businesses need to create a complex blog.
 WordPress Pros  WordPress was originally created as a blogging platform and it has a 4.4/5 rating on G2 with over 8,000 reviews.
Though it has evolved into a multi-purpose content management system, it still has many features and themes for blogging.
 WordPress enables you to not only purchase a custom domain and download one of 3,500+ themes specifically designed for blogs — it also lets you add social media buttons, forms, affiliate links, and other features with plugins.
 The customization options are virtually limitless with the 60,000+ free plugins available.
 WordPress Cons  You will have to make sure your theme and plugins are compatible and up-to-date.
Otherwise, they can disrupt the user experience or break your site.
Other maintenance tasks like finding and fixing broken links, updating the core software, and optimizing your database will also be your responsibility.
This can be difficult for site owners who don't have the time or technical expertise to regularly maintain their sites.
 WordPress Blog Example  Tech Crunch , one of the largest and most popular technology news blogs, is powered by WordPress.
Take a look at this WordPress website example below.
  WordPress Key Takeaways   Ideal for publishers and others who want to extend the platform with plugins  Over 3,500 free blogging themes  Website maintenance can be time-consuming   3.
 Squarespace  Best For: Design   Blog Software Cost: Paid, With Plans From $16-65 per Month  Squarespace Ideal Users  Squarespace is an ideal blogging platform for businesses and individuals creating image-rich content.
It also has a 4.4 rating on G2 .
With Squarespace's award-winning designer templates and integrations with Getty Images, Unsplash, and Google AMP, you can create visual content that's engaging and shareable.
 Squarespace Pros  While Squarespace only offers about 140 templates, they are all mobile-optimized and fully customizable so you can create a blog that looks the way you want it to.
Once you've designed your pages, you can use Squarespace’s blogging and SEO tools to create and optimize your content.
 Finally, after publishing your blog posts, you can connect your social media accounts to easily promote them.
Then use the built-in analytics tool to learn where your traffic is coming from, what your visitors are looking for, and how they’re interacting with your content.
 Squarespace Cons  Squarespace offers even more features , from audio file support to newsletter signup forms, but ultimately it's limited in functionality.
That's because it supports around 30 extensions, so you're mostly limited to the features Squarespace offers out-of-the-box.
 Since they lack some features that bloggers need — like an auto-save feature, for example — Squarespace isn’t the ideal platform for everyone.
 Squarespace Blog Example  Squarespace does allow some bloggers to create beautiful sites, like this lifestyle blog below.
  Squarespace Key Takeaways   Best suited for individuals and brands who want to customize a blog to their personal style  Small but high-quality selection of templates  Limited to features and few extensions that Squarespace offers   4.
 Wix  Best For: Beginners   Blog Software Cost: Paid, With Plans From $16-59 per Month  Wix Ideal Users  Wix is a popular blogging platform for beginners who are looking for hosting and blogging tools in one place and who prioritize speed and design over functionality.
 Wix Pros  Wix has a 4.2 G2 rating and gives you two choices for creating your blog within the Wix Editor.
You can start by choosing from over 800 pre-designed templates that any blogger can use, whether you own a retail business or run a food review website.
You can also use Wix ADI by filling out a quick questionnaire to have a blog created for you.
 Then you can begin writing and editing posts on desktop or mobile, embed Wix's stock photos and videos or your own media, and organize them into topics.
 Once you're done writing, you can configure your SEO settings to boost your organic reach, push your content to your subscribers with Wix's email tool, and share them through your social media accounts.
You can further foster a sense of community among your readers by letting them become members.
 Wix Cons  While Wix is more versatile than other hosted website builders, it lacks customization options and content management features, particularly when comparing Wix vs.
WordPress or another CMS.
 For example, to add more advanced elements to the page, like music or maps, you’ll have to add HTML code.
This process can be intimidating for beginners.
 Wix Blog Example  Take a look at this Wix blogger's site below for an example of a stylish but relatively simple blog.
  Wix Key Takeaways   Ideal for bloggers who prioritize speed and design over functionality  Can use pre-designed templates or start from scratch  Editor lacks drag-and-drop functionality   5.

Pixpa's e-commerce integration and 100+ built-in apps enable bloggers to power up their blog, website and an online store - all in one place.
 Pixpa Cons  While Pixpa offers easy-to-use, out-of-the-box blogging capabilities, it may not provide the advanced customizations and features available in dedicated blogging platforms such as Wordpress.
 No built-in traffic analytics are available.
You need to use Google Analytics or any other similar tool to measure traffic analytics.
 Pixpa Template Example  Pixpa offers a diverse range of blog templates to cater to various blogging styles and aesthetics.
Whether bloggers prefer a minimalistic and clean design or a bold and vibrant look, Pixpa's collection of blog templates offers options to suit diverse preferences.
   Pixpa Key Takeaways   User-friendly interface for easy blog creation and management.
 Customizable templates to match the blogger's unique style.
 Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
 SEO-friendly features to improve search engine visibility.
 Integration with social media for easy content sharing.

 Contently  Best For: Enterprises   Blog Software Cost: Paid, With Quote-Based Pricing  Contently Ideal Users  Contently is a robust blogging platform that's ideal for enterprise companies with large budgets but few internal editorial resources.
It has a 4.5/5 G2 rating with just over 80 reviews.
 Contently Pros  Contently allows you to manage your entire content creation process in one place.
You can create and visualize your editorial strategy with their customizable production calendar tool or organize your blog posts with their tagging tool.
It can also help you effectively collaborate with your team on projects by leveraging their advanced workflow tools.
You can even pay for Contently's well-vetted freelancers to write some of this content for you.

Finally, to refine your content strategy, Contently enables you to compare your content's performance against industry benchmarks, quantify its ROI, and measure its performance by topic, format, and sources directly in your dashboard.
 Contently Cons  The biggest drawback of Contently is that it's beyond many small businesses' and individuals’ budgets.
Contently can be expensive and could be a better fit for enterprise companies.
 They offer quote-based pricing that varies for each client.
Their costs factor in editing, strategy, and help from their content creators, as well as visual assets.
 Contently Blog Example  The Royal Bank of Canada, one of North America’s largest banks, uses Contently to streamline content creation across 14 marketing departments.
Check out its blog below.
  Contently Key Takeaways   Can manage the entire content creation process  Deep-dive analytics  Pricing is mainly for enterprise companies   8 .
Joomla  Best For: Community Building   Blog Software Cost: Paid, With Plans From $8-33 per Month  Joomla Ideal Users  Joomla is an open-source CMS with advanced content and user management features built directly into the platform.
This makes it an excellent choice for creating community-centric blogs.
 Joomla Pros  Joomla offers rich built-in functionality as well as thousands of extensions.
For example, Joomla allows you to create custom post types, manage hundreds of users, and publish content in multiple languages right out of the box.
 It also offers some great extensions for blogging.
EasyBlog by StackIdeas , for example, has a much cleaner drag-and-drop editor than Joomla's built-in editor.
You can also enable star ratings on your blog and automatically publish posts to your social media platforms with this extension.
Joomla’s G2 rating is 4/5 .
 Joomla Cons  Because of its robust built-in functionality, Joomla does have a steeper learning curve than a CMS so it'll take more time to set up.
It also offers a smaller selection of themes and extensions, which can limit your customization options.
 Joomla Blog Example  Below is an example of a Joomla blog built with EasyBlog .
  Joomla Key Takeaways   Advanced content management features  Steep learning curve due to robust built-in functionality  May need a blogging extension   9.

It highlights unnecessary adverbs, hard-to-read and monotonous sentences to help make your writing flow.

Drupal  Best For: Advanced Bloggers   Blog Software Cost: Free, Open-Source Software  Drupal Ideal Users  Drupal is a highly flexible open-source CMS that's best suited for advanced users, as well as enterprise companies, with complex blogging needs who are looking for a self-hosted solution.
It has a G2 rating of 3.8 .
 Drupal Pros  Drupal has hundreds of out-of-the-box features and modules.
If you know how to use them or have the time to learn, then Drupal will give you more power than other open-source platforms.
 Specifically, Drupal supports a wide selection of content types, page templates, blocks, and more for creating and managing content.
It also has advanced user permissions so you can give site admins, content editors, and other stakeholders personalized access to specific content.
This — along with its multilingual capabilities, Layout Builder, and other modules — will allow you to create and manage large, complex blogs.
 Drupal Cons  If you don’t know how to use Drupal's out-of-the-box features and modules, and you don't have the time to learn, they can be confusing and hinder your blogging efforts.
In that case, you might be better off with a simpler platform.
 Drupal Blog Example  Below is a Drupal blog that features add-ons and modules.
  Drupal Key Takeaways   Best suited for technical users with complex blogging needs  Powerful content management features  Advanced user permissions   12.
LinkedIn  Best For: Thought Leadership   Blog Software Cost: Free  LinkedIn Ideal Users  LinkedIn lets users directly share blog posts, helping users reach some of the 875M people on the platform.
This gives businesses with new blogs an audience for thought leadership and to drive site traffic.
 LinkedIn Pros  LinkedIn is an excellent choice for blogging to build brand awareness and drive site traffic.
It's also a valuable tool to develop thought leadership.
The built-in audience on LinkedIn can help generate conversations about your content that can boost growth.
 It's also an excellent choice to supplement an on-site blog.
Creating a LinkedIn blog can help you create insightful content specifically for niche users.
This can build industry awareness of your brand and products.
It can also help your blog generate more authority.
 LinkedIn Cons  Because LinkedIn blogs live on their platform, you won't get the SEO benefits of an on-site blog.
It will also be important to optimize your blogs for search on their platform as well as search engines.
Without this investment, it's possible that only your current connections will see your content.
 You also may want to look for another platform if you're blogging for lead generation.
Blogs are a great way to collect new contacts for your newsletter and sales team.
But blogging on LinkedIn can mean a longer journey to your lead generation forms, which can decrease conversion.
 LinkedIn Blog Example  These blog examples are from the COO of L'Oréal and the Chief Customer and Commercial Officer at Coca-Cola .
They show how this platform can build awareness and engagement for brand initiatives.
  LinkedIn Key Takeaways   A good pick for new thought leaders  Easy-to-use interface  Offers potential access to a large and immediate audience   13.
Write.as  Best For: Privacy   Blog Software Cost: Free, With Premium Options  Write.as Ideal Users  Write.as is a lightweight blogging platform that's ideal for individuals looking to create simple blogs with minimal design.
It’s popular with its user base, with a 4.4 rating and almost 30 reviews on G2.
 Write.as Pros  Offering a stripped-down editor with nothing but an auto-save feature, Write.as offers the experience of writing in a virtual journal.
This makes it another of the best blogging platforms for writers.
Write.as is also free to use and doesn't support ads.
 Teams can also use it like Google Docs to share updates, proposals, and works-in-progress (for a monthly subscription).
 Write.as Cons  Write.as does require you to use Markdown , a syntax that uses special characters to format text.
For example, you'd type in asterisks to create bullet points, hashtags to create headers, and [Link] to add a link.
 The syntax isn’t difficult to learn, but it might take some practice.
If you'd prefer to simply click a button to create bullet lists or add hyperlinks, then you'll be better off with another blogging platform.
 Write.as Blog Example  Check out an example of a writing blog below.
  Write.as Key Takeaways   Best for individuals who want a minimalist interface and design  Requires you to learn and use Markdown syntax  Free version is ad-free   14.
Blogger  Best For: Lifestyle Bloggers   Blog Software Cost: Free  Blogger Ideal Users  Blogger is a free platform designed for newbie bloggers.
While it lacks many content management features, Blogger is more feature-rich than most free blogging platforms.
For that reason, Blogger is perfect for individuals looking to create blogs as a hobby.
 Blogger Pros  The biggest advantage of Blogger is how easy it is to create and customize a relatively basic blog.
 To get started, you just need to create an account with Google, choose a template, and get publishing.
You can purchase a custom domain, optimize your SEO settings, connect your blog to Google Analytics, optimize your posts with Adsense, and even edit the HTML and CSS of your site — but you won't be able to do much beyond that.
 Blogger Cons  To get a better sense of the platform's limitations, you can compare Blogger vs.
WordPress or another CMS.
With Blogger, you can't install plugins to extend the functionality of your site.
You can't create different content types, like portfolio pages.
And you can't change the default display of your content from reverse-chronological order to, say, your most popular posts.
 In short, if you need the content management features and customization options of a CMS, then look into alternatives to Blogger.
 Blogger Blog Example  Take a look at this personal blog below for an example.
  Key Takeaways   Best for lifestyle bloggers  More feature-rich than other free blogging platforms  Can't create custom post types or change the display of posts   15.
Medium  Best For: Writers   Blog Software Cost: Free, With Premium Options  Medium Ideal Users  Medium is often called the best blogging platform for writers.
It gives businesses a chance to build a blog and connect with a wide range of industry-specific users.
Storytelling is popular on Medium, and many businesses use this to their advantage to build a blog audience.
 Medium Pros  This blogging platform is easy to use and publish content.
 Another pro is Medium's readership.
The site also features a reader recommendation engine that can generate an audience for new blogs.
Since on-site blogs can often take six months or more to generate traffic, a site like Medium can be an attractive alternative.
 Medium also has community publications.
Each user on the platform can create up to seven publications.
Users can also submit blogs to Medium publications to build a larger audience.
For example, the Towards Data Science publication has over 645,000 followers.
 If you're just starting out, Medium publications can help draw attention and followers to your new blog.
This blogging platform can also complement a website blog, and some businesses republish their onsite blog content here without worrying about penalties.
 Medium Cons  Like LinkedIn, a Medium blog won’t help you get the SEO benefits of an on-site blog.
It also has a large community that can favor trends or long-time members over newcomers.
While you can use Medium to generate traffic for an on-site blog, it may present a duplicate content risk if you don't properly set up your website.
 Medium Blog Example  Both businesses and government agencies use Medium to promote their brand content.
  Medium Key Takeaways   Ideal for writers and others who want to connect with an existing audience  Clean and simple interface  Less likely to offer the SEO and lead generation benefits of an on-site blog   16.
Tumblr  Best For: Multimedia   Blog Software Cost: Free  Ideal Users  Tumblr appeals to personal bloggers and brands alike.
While bloggers might be able to use this as their only platform, brands tend to use it as one platform among many to show their personality.
 Tumblr Pros  Tumblr combines the power of blogging and social networking in one highly-visual publishing platform.
 Tumblr offers everything you need to create a professional-looking site.
You can select from hundreds of free and premium themes and add multiple pages, sidebars, social sharing buttons, comment sections, and more.
You can also buy a custom domain name from a domain name registrar rather than use the free subdomain: yourusername.tumblr.com.
If you have HTML coding skills, you can further customize your site.
 When you’re satisfied with your site's design, you can start creating and publishing multimedia post types.
Featuring photos, GIFs, links, chat dialogue, audio files, and video in your content makes it more engaging, memorable, and shareable.
 Since other users can easily like, reply, and reblog your posts on their Tumblr as well as their other social accounts, right from their dashboard, this is an excellent platform for engaging and fostering an online community.
 Tumblr Cons  There are restrictions on the site that can frustrate users.
For example, you can only schedule (or "queue") 50 posts in a day, which might limit your ability to plan and execute a long-term content strategy.
You can also only upload videos under 500MB and only track 20 tags at a time.
Furthermore, your site can be suspended at any time if you’re found in violation of Tumblr’s community guidelines .
 Tumblr Blog Example  Vogue has a highly visual and multimedia-rich site on Tumblr.
Check it out below.
  Key Takeaways   Ideal for publishing multimedia posts  Restrictions on what you post, when, and how often  Ideal for individuals and brands to engage with followers   Get Started Blogging  Once you figure out your blogging goals and needs, you can choose the right blogging platform.
With a little focus, you can find a tool with the functionality and flexibility you're looking for.
 Whichever platform you decide on should combine ease of use and power to propel your business.
So get choosing and start blogging to reap the SEO and traffic benefits.

 This site also leverages movement.
Instead of a hero image, the site opens with a sizzle reel with the firm’s value proposition.

By Experience keeps the site monochrome with different shades of blue.
The white text easily pops and stays easy to read.

Tux Creative House   Links on the site itself are minimalist, using only small white and black text.
The images are odd and somewhat jarring, but this is by design — it’s almost impossible not to want to know more about what’s happening.
 The photos and videos can be a little overwhelming, but the studio communicates its message through images rather than words.
 What we like: Each section of the home page is a different project.
As you scroll, your cursor becomes a popup box, which includes a still image from the campaign and a call for you to “See the project.” This unique web element offers a unique, creative flair.
 Best for: Creative companies, ad agencies, artists, and designers.
 16.
Jean Mazouni   This portfolio site is clean and simple, offering only black text on a white background.
Links to work and contact pages are easy to find, and there’s no mistaking what this web developer does for a living.

 Best for: Web developers and design studios.
 17.
Meteorit   Web design and development company Meteorit leaned into its space-themed namesake with a striking portfolio page that encourages users to scroll down and see what this company has to offer.

Here, visitors can interact with the company’s past projects.
You can also click each image to learn more about the project.
 Best for: Architecture firms, development companies, agencies, and consultants.
 18.
Cinch PR   The first image on Cinch PR’s site gives off a classic, retro feeling that also highlights the company’s ability to put brands front and center — exactly what a great PR firm should do.
It continues with a carousel of images of other projects.
 The layout below uses large images, lots of white space, and minimal text for ease of viewing.
 What we love: Instead of a static hero image, Cinch PR opens with a gif that showcases different projects its team has previously worked on.
This showcases the range of companies Cinch has partnered with no scrolling required.
 Best for: PR firms, design companies, ad agencies, marketing agencies, and consultants.
 19.
Steve Wolf Designs   The Steve Wolf Designs page isn’t particularly loud or bright, but it showcases what the business can do for brands.
More importantly, it captures the mission of the company: to help brands create meaning.
 The homepage serves as a gallery of past projects and inspiration for what clients could receive from partnering with the studio.
 What we like: After scrolling past projects, the studio lists the services it offers to clients.
This helps visitors determine if a partnership with Steve Wolf Designs will meet their needs.
 Best for: Design companies and creative agencies.

 Best for: Web and UX designers.
 21.
Christina Vanessa   As with many sites on our list, simplicity helps this portfolio stand out.
 Compelling clips of shoes and a few links are all it takes to make visitors curious to explore more.
Don’t be afraid to show off what makes your work special to grab visitors' attention.
 What we like: The pictures on Vanessa’s site include a variety of colors and hues.
The neutral beige and white background makes sure that these images don’t clash with the site design or each other.
 Best for: Photographers, creative agencies, and studios.
 22.
Ruslan Slavnivy   What does Ruslan Slavnivy offer?
Portraits.
How do we know this?
He’s made it the singular focus of his portfolio site.

 What we like: Clicking on each image in the carousel takes you to a gallery of photos from each of his categories.
This makes navigating the site straightforward for visitors.
 Best for: Photographers and artists.
 23.
GBL Studio   This branding and design firm uses a great tagline to capture attention.
GBL stands out from the crowd by making it clear that they can help companies “play” in the often serious space of creative marketing.
 Pro tip: Create and display a catchy tagline that effectively communicates your values and mission.
 Best for: Design companies, consultants, and agencies.
 24.
Ministry Design   What does this company do?
One line on the otherwise blank homepage makes it clear.
It’s a great use of space and time — if this is what customers want, they’ll click through.
If not, they’ll leave.
 What we like: Animations load on scroll, creating a dynamic experience.
This plays especially well for web developers, as you show potential clients your coding prowess.
 Best for: Web developers and agencies.
 25.
Sergio Diaz Schiaffino   This portfolio site looks and feels like an old-school Windows desktop.
Click on one of the icons, and it even opens a retro-looking window.
This portfolio site grabs attention from the first moment by melding the old and the new.
 What we like: The nostalgic experience extends to the site’s loading pages.
An old-school loading bar appears as the site boots up, reading, “Loading up.”  Best for: Sites that want to create a retro experience.
 How to Design a Portfolio Website  Ready to get started with your own site?
While there are no hard-and-fast rules for effective portfolio design, here are six steps to get your site off on the right foot.
 1.
Choose your style.
 First, decide what style you prefer.
This could be stark and simple, busy and loud, cool and collected, or any other combination of the styles we highlighted above.
 For this step, it’s not so important what you pick as that you stick to it — consistency is key for effective branding.
You should also consider what style best fits with your offerings.
 2.
Define your keywords.
 Next up are keywords.
What phrase(s) are you hoping to rank for in organic searches?
Here, it’s a good idea to conduct some research and see which keywords have high search volumes and which sites currently rank well for these keywords.
 3.
Scope out the competition.
 Speaking of research, take the time to visit other sites with a similar focus to yours.
For example, if you’re a graphic designer, look at some great graphic design sites and see what stands out.
 The goal here isn’t mimicry but inspiration — if something captures your attention, it’s probably worth pursuing.
 4.
Pick your best work.
 Your portfolio site doesn’t need to showcase all of your work on the front page.
Instead, pick work you’re especially proud of or that is particularly striking to help generate immediate visitor interest.
 5.
Brag a little.
 In most cases, bragging isn’t optimal.
However, when it comes to your portfolio site, it’s your time to shine.
Don't hesitate to share if you’ve just completed a great project or landed a new client.
 6.
Offer engagement.
 While your portfolio site is often where potential clients first land, they may not choose to work with you right away.
To keep them coming back, it’s worth offering ways they can engage with your brand over time.
 This might include email newsletters, blogs, or social media pages to follow.
 You get one chance to make a first impression.
 So use it wisely.
Take the time to review some of the best portfolio websites online, then create a site of your own that reflects your creativity, highlights what you have to offer, and makes it easy for prospective clients to get in touch.

  Additionally, many potential clients will use your photography portfolio as an opportunity to check out past clients with whom you've worked to get a gauge for how legitimate you are.
If they can't find you online, or they don't feel particularly inspired by your portfolio, they won't feel compelled to work with you.
 No pressure, right?
  Fortunately, there are plenty of impressive photography portfolio websites out there to use for inspiration.
To avoid reinventing the wheel, take a look at our list of 21 most memorable photography portfolio websites.

With so many portfolios out there, it's hard to figure out how to make yours stand out from the crowd.
  What colors should you use?
What kind of writing samples will show off your skills?
Fortunately, I've put together a collection of copywriting portfolio examples that are sure to inspire you and guide you in the right direction.
 Each copywriting portfolio example I've included is unique in terms of color, layout, and personality — highlighting the various ways you can approach putting a portfolio together and how it's okay to get creative with yours.
  How to Create a Copywriting Portfolio  When creating your copywriting portfolio , avoid cramming in too many of your writing samples.
You'll want to show off your diverse portfolio —that's understandable — but too many samples can overwhelm potential clients and employers.
 Instead, opt for five or six writing samples that capture the different styles of writing you've done, such as technical, marketing, and business writing.
Be sure to also include a balance of humorous and serious pieces, B2B and B2C writings, as well as short and long-form content.
 If you have little-to-no writing samples, build your portfolio by starting a website or blog to showcase your writing skills, or contribute to other websites.
You can also write for nonprofits or work internships.
 Another method to build your portfolio is to write mock-copywriting samples based on local businesses.
Just be sure to let employers or clients know they are mock-samples and that you weren't actually hired by those companies.
The point isn't to deceive, but to show what you can do.

 Access now     Learn more           Copywriting Portfolio Examples  Now that you have a few of your best copywriting examples ready to upload, it's time to design your portfolio.
You want a portfolio that stands out from the crowd, showcases your personality, highlights your skills, and is easy to navigate by potential employers.
 To give you some inspiration, here are 25 examples of excellent copywriting portfolios broken down into the following categories:   Homepage – The first page people see of your online portfolio and where you'll likely house your work samples  About Me – Where you'll give readers an idea of who you are and what you do  Services – What you can provide your clients   Each of these examples presents a different approach to copywriting portfolios that is sure to attract new opportunities.
 Homepage  There are many different approaches to creating a homepage for your portfolio — however, it's best practice to ensure your homepage features your name, your contact information, and complementary colors.
Most copywriters choose to feature their work directly on their homepage, but some find a way to link to their samples.
 Here are several examples of outstanding homepage templates:  1.
Carline Anglade-Cole  The homepage for Anglade-Cole's copywriting portfolio immediately establishes her as an expert in her field by bringing attention to the awards she's garnered throughout her career.
The photo on her front page shows her at a speaking engagement with a confident smile, and the photo's caption clearly states her full name above "3X Award-Winning Direct-Response Copywriter, Author, and Consultant."  The badges for her awards are also displayed throughout, with the American Writers and Artists Institute badge placed in the middle next to the link to subscribe to her email list.
Beneath her email list are badges from other accomplishments, including winning the bronze Nonfiction Book Award.
If you're an award-winning copywriter, Anglade-Cole's page is a great example of how you can place your awards front and center to establish credibility.
 2.
Gari Cruze  If you want your homepage to focus less on awards and more on who you've worked with, Cruze's homepage is an outstanding example.
This homepage heavily features high-quality photos from the different campaigns he's worked on.
Simply hover over each photo to see the name of the company or campaign, then click on the photo to see the copy he wrote and where it was published.
 If you're looking for a more straight-forward yet eye-catching approach to displaying your work, Cruze's example can lead you in the right direction.
 3.
Evan Benner  Benner takes a similar approach by using a mixture of high-quality photos and GIFs to display his work on his portfolio's homepage.
However, Benner takes it a step further by including the year his work was published next to each photo.
His homepage also includes a headshot and a small blurb about who he is and where he is based.
 Potential clients and employers can easily navigate his portfolio by scrolling down where they can see more links to his About page ("Meet Evan"), copy, and the projects he worked on.
 4.
Jose Carlos Benítez  Copywriting portfolios don't have to be all work and no play, so don't be afraid to inject a little humor if you can.
Benítez's personality and sense of humor are sprinkled throughout his portfolio's homepage.
 Upon visiting his website, you're greeted with a black screen with white text that starts with "Hello there, human! Or robot!" and ends with "Scroll down to see the blood, sweat and tears." And for laughs, there's a random button that says "This is just a button." Spoiler Alert: The button doesn't do anything but I definitely laughed after I clicked on it and waited 30 seconds for something (nothing) to happen.
 Once you scroll down, you'll see a display of GIFs of the different campaigns Benítez has worked on over the years.
Similar to Cruze and Brenner's portfolios, hovering over the GIFs will show the name of the company the campaign was for — and clicking on them will take you to his work.
 Featuring a bit of your personality throughout the portfolio will give potential clients and employers an idea of the kind of person they're working with — and their humor and vision might line up with yours.
 5.
Benji Shaw  If you want to include imagery in your portfolio, but prefer a more minimalist approach, then Shaw's portfolio will spark a few ideas.
This portfolio features a black background with his name displayed in a large, easy-to-read font in the upper left corner.
Two large images representing his work are featured in the foreground, and more of his work is shown by simply scrolling down.
Like in previous examples, clicking the images will take you to another page that gives greater detail on the projects he's worked on.
 6.
Aly J.
Yale  Another excellent example for minimalists, Yale's portfolio doesn't rely on a ton of imagery.
Instead her homepage is straightforward, simple, and only features her name in large black text against a white background —along with tabs in the upper right hand corner that lead to her bio, homepage, and contact page.
 If you scroll down Yale's homepage, you see the logos of the outlets that have published her work.
 Though I'd definitely suggest including a tab with links to your written work, this homepage shows that sometimes less is more and that you don't have to rely on bold images to have a strong portfolio.

Davina van Buren  The homepage for van Buren's portfolio is a great example for copywriters who are looking for a neat, organized way of promoting all of their talents, work, and social media in one place.
  The content of the homepage is organized in a way that leads your eyes down the page.
Its coordinated neutral colors are engaging without being too jarring.
Also, notice how the tabs for the about page, portfolio, testimonials, contact information, and social media widgets are all neatly organized in a single row at the top.
 This format is great if you're a copywriter who prefers a clean-cut, business professional portfolio.
 8.
Stephan Marsh  This portfolio is a great example if you're the kind of copywriter who wants to get straight to the point.
With a tagline in big bold letters reading "Read less of what I say.
See more of what I've done," Marsh makes it clear that he does not want to waste anyone's time.
The top of his homepage even includes a self-contained PDF portfolio that can be downloaded immediately.
 This portfolio shows that even a person of few words can still find a way to make a bold first impression.
 9.
Jennifer Cheek  I love this homepage example because it shows how a copywriter can add their own personal touch to a portfolio template .
What makes this portfolio stand out is its fun pink hues and the adorable yellow canary logo on the left side of the page.
Once again, don't be afraid to show your personality on your portfolio's homepage, and that includes your quirky side.
 10.
Anna Rogan  Rogan's homepage, like van Buran's, also leads your eye downward.
As you scroll down you'll see more of her work samples, but what makes her page really interesting is that each sample comes with a corresponding color change.
This makes for a fun, aesthetically pleasing scroll through her work.
 11.
Kayla Dean  Dean's portfolio is called The Literary Co. and starts by letting visitors know she has a wealth of experience, having created copy for more than 100 clients.
Her portfolio also has a blog-style setup where potential clients can scroll down and see all of her latest work, case studies, and the brands she has worked with.
 12.
Dayarne Smith  Smith's website opens with a large image of a woman at a keyboard and features all of her relevant tabs at the top of the homepage.
Once you scroll down, you'll see her portfolio with links to her work uniquely displayed in fun monitor illustrations.
 13.
Sara Frandina  Frandina leaned into the writing theme by having her portfolio's homepage resemble notebook paper.
She doubled down on the theme by crossing out a word in the tagline and "writing" in a new word.
 In addition to having standard information tabs at the top of the page, Frandina also included tabs linking to her past works separated by categories — customer research, email sequences, launch copy, long-form sales page, and website copy.
These tabs can be found by scrolling down the homepage.
  About Me  This is where you showcase your personality and clearly define the expertise you bring as a copywriter.
Notice that each example features a photo of the copywriter.
 14.
Kim Hobson  Figuring out what to say about yourself can be difficult.
Where do you even start?
Hobson found a way around that by breaking her About page into sections.
In her introduction, she includes a photo of herself followed by a brief overview of what she does, where she is based, and how long she has been copywriting.
 Below her overview, she lists five quick facts about herself — some of which pertain to copywriting and others that cover her personal life.
Then she has a section that breaks down her professional background.
  If you're not sure what to put in your About page, you can follow Hobson's formula by including a brief overview followed by a few fun facts and a breakdown of your career thus far.
 15.
Flourish Writing  Sarah, whose portfolio is called Flourish Writing, introduces herself using a funny anecdote about her first "published book" being written on craft paper and stored on her elementary school's shelf for years.
This anecdote lets the reader know Sarah has had a passion for writing since she was a child and that passion can also produce excellent work.
 Complete with a photo of Sarah with her adorable pup, this About page gives the reader a clear idea of who Sarah is when she isn't writing.
 16.
Shanice Perriatt  Perriatt's About page is concise and well organized.
Her opener clearly states her name and what she does: "I'm Shanice Perriatt – a digital marketer and content creator who blends the best of design and writing into compelling and engaging brand content."  Like Sarah, Perriatt also gives us insight into her life and hobbies – going to the gym, scrolling through Twitter, and going to the movies.
Finally, the bio ends with Perriatt telling the reader the position she holds now.

 Access now     Learn more           The muted pastel background complements the green around headshot, making for a clean, informative page.
 17.
Kayla Hollatz  Hollatz takes a different approach to her About page.
First, it starts with a photo of Hollatz next to a brief statement detailing her objective.
 After scrolling down, visitors see an "About You" page instead of an "About Me" page.
This is where Hollatz presents an issue many clients face.
 Finally, visitors can scroll further down to find an About Me page in which Hollatz presents herself as the answer to all of the potential client's problems.
 18.
Andie Coupland  Coupland's About page shows that it is perfectly fine to veer away from personal details and to keep things strictly business.
While we don't get insight into Coupland's life outside of writing, we do get a clear description of her experience and what she brings to the table as a copywriter.
Note that she also includes a link to her LinkedIn for more information.
 19.
Jacob McMillen  McMillen's About page establishes credibility by focusing on his accomplishments.
He also puts his own spin on the writer's headshot by instead only showing half his face.
It's a bold move but the gray coloring complements the muted blue and white banner, so it doesn't seem too out of place.
 20.
James Schlesinger  Like Hollatz, Schlesinger uses his About page to present a problem potential clients could be facing, then he presents himself as the solution by explaining exactly what he can do for them.
Then he ends his bio with a call to action, urging readers to contact him for his services.
 21.
John Axtell  Are you looking for a punchy opener to grab the reader's attention?
Why not try "I love high kicks!" Maybe avoid that exact phrase, since that's how Axtell decided to open his About page, but shouting a random fact about yourself is definitely a good start.
Axtell took the opener a step further by including a photo of him doing a high kick.
  If you decide to open with a fun fact, like Axtell, coupling that opener with a photo showing that fact can definitely show your personality and grab the attention of potential clients.
 Services  Some copywriters opt to dedicate a separate page of their online portfolio to breaking down the specific services they provide.
If you choose to do the same, here are a couple of examples you can reference:  22.
Danielle Wallace  Wallace chose to separate her services into different clickable boxes that include icons and a mixture of script and typewriting fonts.
 23.
Sandy Dang  Dang displays her services in a more horizontal format with texts on one side and a large corresponding photo on the other.
Each section of her service page includes a button that gives the option to book.
 24.
Jennifer Locke  Lock kept the format straightforward by simply stating what she can do for the client and including a button that allows potential clients to schedule a consultation.
This could be a great method for copywriters who specialize in only one for two services.
 25.
Stuart Tarn  Of course, sometimes your portfolio is enough to show clients and employers what you're capable of.
Tarn organized his portfolio in a simple way that shows he can provide web, email, social, and print copy.
Clicking on each image will take the reader to his previous work.
 All of these copywriting portfolio examples are unique, but are all well organized, easy to navigate, and show a dash of personality while using complementary or neutral colors.
Remember these points when putting together your own portfolio.

It’s more than a professional showcase; it‘s a reflection of who you are in the digital world .
Whether you’re an artist, a freelancer, or a developer like myself, a well-crafted portfolio can be your strongest ally.
It's where you make your first impression, tell your story, and display your achievements in your own unique style.
  As someone who ventured into the world of web development , I know the prospect of creating a portfolio site can seem challenging.
That‘s why I’m here to guide you through it.
In this guide, I'll walk you through building your personal portfolio using HTML and CSS .
These tools have been the cornerstone of my journey in web design and development, and now I want to share this knowledge with you.
 Regardless of your level of expertise, this guide is meant to help you create a portfolio that not only stands out but also truly represents you.
Let's embark on this journey together, creating a space that showcases not just your work but your personal and professional growth.
   Overview of My Portfolio Website  Creating a personal portfolio website was a pivotal step in my professional journey.
As a developer, I wanted a space that not only showcased my technical skills but also reflected my personality and professional ethos.
My portfolio is a balanced blend of creativity and functionality, a place where my projects, experiences, and aspirations come to life.
 To illustrate, let's explore a practical example on CodePen, providing a hands-on approach to building a portfolio.
  See the Pen HTML Projects: Personal Portfolio Page by HubSpot ( @hubspot )
  on CodePen .
   View on CodePen  Design Philosophy:  The design of my portfolio is rooted in simplicity and ease of navigation.
I believe that a clean, uncluttered layout enhances the user experience, allowing my work to take center stage.
I've used a minimalistic color scheme and typography that align with my personal brand , ensuring that the website feels like an extension of myself.
 Content Structure:  The content is strategically organized to guide visitors through my professional story:   Header: An eye-catching background image and a professional profile logo , enhancing the visual appeal and making the introduction more engaging.
 About Section: A more personal look into who I am, my journey, and my passions in the field of web development.
 Portfolio Showcase: A gallery of my projects.
Each project should normally have a brief description of the technologies used, links to live demos and code repositories.
 Contact Information: A straightforward and accessible section for visitors to reach out to me, be it for potential collaborations, opportunities, or just a friendly conversation.
  Technical Aspects:  From a technical standpoint, the site is built primarily with HTML and CSS, with a focus on:   HTML5: For structuring the content in a semantic and SEO-friendly manner.
 CSS3: To style the website and ensure it is responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on various devices.
 Bootstrap Framework: Utilized for its responsive design features and pre-built components, which expedited the development process.
  In the following sections, I'll break down the steps I took to build this portfolio, hoping to inspire and guide you to create your own unique digital space.
  Planning and Structuring Your Portfolio  Before diving into coding, we must plan and structure our portfolio.
This stage sets the foundation for a cohesive and effective website.
  With these elements in place, you‘re now ready to start the exciting part – bringing your portfolio to life through code.
In the next section, we’ll dive into the development process, starting with setting up your HTML structure.
  Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your Personal Portfolio Page  Step 1: Setting Up the HTML Structure:  With your plan in place, it‘s time to start building the structure of your portfolio using HTML.
This step involves creating the basic skeleton of your site, onto which you’ll later add style and functionality.
 1.
Setting Up Your Workspace:   Choose a Code Editor: Before you start coding, select a code editor .
Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
 Create a Project Folder: Organize your files by creating a dedicated project folder on your computer.
This will contain all your HTML, CSS, images, and other resources.
  2.
Structuring Your HTML File  Start by creating a new file named index.html, which will serve as the main page of your portfolio.
 Begin with the basic HTML5 structure, including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, and the opening and closing tags for <html>, <head>, and <body>.
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name - Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
   <header>
    <!-- Navigation bar -->
  </header>
  <main>
    <section id="about">
      <!-- About me content -->
    </section>
    <section id="portfolio">
      <!-- Portfolio items -->
    </section>
    <section id="contact">
      <!-- Contact form -->
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <!-- Footer content -->
  </footer>
</body>
</html>   By carefully creating and structuring your HTML file, you lay a solid foundation for your portfolio.
This framework not only organizes your content effectively but also sets the stage for the next steps, where you will add content to your portfolio.
  Step 2: Adding Content to Your HTML Structure  After establishing the HTML framework of your portfolio, the next essential step is to infuse it with content that represents your professional skills, projects, and personal flair.
This is where your portfolio begins to take shape, transforming from a basic layout into a compelling narrative of your professional journey.
 Example Content Integration in HTML:   <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Personal Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header class="header-background">
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        <div class="header-content">

    <footer>
        <p>Copyright (c) 2023 Jane Doe -- All Rights Reserved</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>    Header: Use the <header> tag to create a section that typically contains your navigation bar and logo.
This is the first thing visitors will see, so make it impactful yet straightforward.
 About Section: Utilize a <section> tag with an id of about for your personal introduction.
This section should include a brief bio and a photo, offering a glimpse into who you are professionally and personally.
 Portfolio Section: Create another <section> for displaying your work.
Within this section, use <article> or <div> tags to separate and organize each project or piece of work you want to showcase.
 Contact Section: Add a <section id=“contact”> for your contact details.
This is where you can include a simple contact form, making it easy for potential clients or employers to reach out to you.
 Footer: The <footer> section is essential for additional information.
This could include social media links, a copyright notice, or other relevant links and information.
   Step 3: Styling with CSS  With your portfolio's content in place, the next step is to bring it to life with styling.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to add colors, fonts, layout designs, and much more to make your portfolio visually appealing and reflective of your personal brand.
 Example Content Integration in HTML:   :root {
    --primary-color: #29a598;
    --text-color: #394c4a;
    --background-light: #ffffff;
    --header-height: 100vh;
}

    box-sizing: border-box;
}

    font-size: 110%;
}

}

.header-background {
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(255, 254, 253, 0.7), rgba(255, 254, 253, 0.9)),

    padding: 15px 0;
}

    padding: 0;
    text-align: center;
}

nav ul li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 10px;
}

nav ul li a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-family: 'Unica One', cursive;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.header-content img {
    max-width: 250px;
    border-radius: 50%;
}

.header-content h1, .header-content p {
    margin: 0.5rem 0;
    font-family: 'Unica One', cursive;

}

#about {
    background-color: #ffffff; 
    padding-left: 40px;
    padding-right: 40px;
    margin: 40px;
    border-radius: 0.5%;
    text-align: center;
}

.profile-photo {
    max-width: 40%;
    height: auto; 
    border-radius: 50%; 
}

#portfolio {
    background-color: #0fbfbf; 
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 0.5%;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.project {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    margin: 10px;
    display: inline-block;
    line-height: 200px;

}

footer {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
}

/* Additional Styles */
h2 {
    color: #333;
    font-family: 'Unica One', cursive;
    font-size: 2.3rem;
}

    nav ul li {
        display: block;
        margin: 10px 0;
    }
  
  .profile-photo {
        width: 50%; 
        margin: 0 auto; 
    }
}     Root Variables: Sets custom CSS properties (variables) like --primary-color , --text-color , --background-light , and --header-height .
This makes it easy to maintain consistency and change these values globally if needed later.
 Box Sizing:  Ensures that padding and border sizes are included in the total width and height of elements, making layout management more predictable.
 HTML and Body: The html tag's font size is set to 110%, increasing the default size of text slightly.
The body tag styles include setting the font family to 'Work Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif, default text color, line height for readability, and hiding horizontal overflow (overflow-x).
 Header Background: Applies a background image and a linear gradient overlay for the header, making it visually striking.
It's set to cover the full viewport height (100vh) and is centered using flexbox.
 Navigation Bar: The nav tag styles position the navigation bar at the top with a semi-transparent background.
The ul within nav centers the list items (links) and removes default list styling.
nav ul li a styles the navigation links with white color, a specific font, and size.
 Header Content: Styles the profile image with a maximum width and round shape (border-radius).
.header-content h1 , .header-content p apply custom font styling to header elements.
 Sections: Each section has unique background colors, padding, margin, border-radius for rounded corners, and text-align for center alignment.
.profile-photo styles the image in the About section to be responsive (max-width: 40%) and round.
 Project Styling: Styles individual project boxes in the portfolio section with fixed dimensions, border, margin, and center alignment of text.
 Contact Section and Footer: They are styled similarly to other sections but with their unique background colors and padding.
 Additional Styles: They are styled with custom fonts, colors, and hover effects.
 Media Queries: Contains styles for mobile responsiveness, altering the layout and size of elements for smaller screens, particularly the navigation menu and profile photo.
  Voila! You have now created a personal portfolio website.
This CSS setup ensures a clean, professional look with a personal touch, providing a good user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Made With In Houston, Tx           How to Use Inspect Element in Chrome, Safari, & Firefox    Download Now: 25 Free HTML & CSS Hacks        Jamie Juviler     Published: June 20, 2023       In a way, the job of web developers and designers is to convince users that a website is one singular entity, more than just a series of HTML elements formatted to look nice.
With the right tools, however, even non-developers can peel back the curtain on any website to see what’s really happening behind the scenes.
   You might be familiar with the classic “view page source” trick, which displays the raw HTML of a page in the browser window.
But, there’s a better way to do your detective work: The inspect element feature lets us view and even modify any website’s front-end, which can be quite useful when building a website or learning how websites work .
 In this post, we’ll discuss what it means to “inspect” page elements, and how to do so on three common web browsers.
If you’re in a pinch, jump ahead to what you’re looking for.
  How to Inspect Elements in Chrome  How to Inspect Elements in Safari  How to Inspect Elements in Firefox      What does ‘inspect element’ mean?
  Inspect element is a feature of modern web browsers that enables anyone to view and edit a website’s source code, including its HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files.
When the source code is modified with the inspect tool, the changes are shown live inside the browser window.
     Inspect is a web professional’s scout team.
Developers, designers, and marketers frequently use it to peek inside any website (including their own) to preview content and style changes, fix bugs, or learn how a particular website is built.
For instance, if you find an intriguing interface on a competing website, inspect element lets you see the HTML and CSS that make it up.
 You can also think of your browser’s inspect feature as a “sandbox” of sorts: Play around with a web page as much as you want by changing content, colors, fonts, layouts, etc.
When finished, just refresh the page to revert everything to normal.
Inspect doesn’t change the website itself — only how it appears in your browser — so feel free to experiment!    We're committed to your privacy.

Instead of viewing plain source code, use inspect element to interact with the page and see how each line of code maps to an element or style.
By better understanding what constitutes the typical web page, you can communicate effectively with developers in the case of an error, or if you want to make a change.
 Inspect may be a “developer tool,” but you don’t need to write any code or install any additional software to use it.
You can do everything I’ve described right inside your browser — let’s learn how.
    How to Inspect Elements   To inspect elements you have to right-click any part of a webpage and click Inspect > Inspect Element.
Alternatively, you can press Command+Option+i on your Mac or F12 on your PC to do the same.
     Every modern web browser has a native tool for inspecting elements.
It can be accessed in any browser, but some browsers like Chrome and Safari have slight differences.
Let’s discuss how to use the inspect tool in three desktop web browsers: Google Chrome, Apple’s Safari, and Mozilla Firefox.
  How To Inspect Elements in Chrome  Chrome comes with a handy developer tool that allows you to inspect individual elements.
This allows you to see the code behind a webpage, and even edit it on your own browser.
(Note that the changes are only visible to you, not to anyone else across the web.)  Here's how to get started:  1.
Launch Chrome and navigate to the page you want to inspect.
 To use the element inspector in Google Chrome, first navigate to any web page.
In these examples, I’ll be using HubSpot.com .
 2.
Open up the Inspect panel.
 Once you arrive at your desired page, you have several ways to open Chrome's Inspect tool.
  Option 1 : Right-click any part of the page and choose Inspect .
Right-clicking a specific page element will open that element in the inspector view.
 Option 2 : In the top menu bar, select View > Developer > Developer Tools .
 Option 3: Click the three-dot icon in the top right corner of the browser window.
From there, choose More Tools > Developer Tools .
Then, click the Inspect tab in the popup.
 Option 4 : Use the shortcut control-shift-C on Windows or command-option-C on macOS.
  3.
Change the location of the inspect panel.
 To better view the code, you can change the position of the inspector window.
 The Chrome Developer Tools panel will open at the bottom of the browser window, but sometimes it opens in a separate window altogether.
 If you want to change the location of the panel, click the three-dots icon in the top right corner of the panel (next to the X icon), then choose your preferred dock position.
 I’ll choose Dock to right — this makes it easier to view the rendered page and its source:   Along the top of the inspect panel, you’ll see tabs for Elements , Console , Sources , etc.
These are all tools we can use to assess a page’s contents and performance.
However, everything we need for inspecting is under the Elements tab.
 4.
Look at the source HTML code of the page.
 The biggest area of the panel will contain the source HTML of the current page.
Take some time to explore this region, and notice how hovering the cursor over the piece of code highlights the corresponding element on the page.
 Blue indicates the contents of an element, green corresponds to padding , and areas in orange are margins .
  5.
Select a specific element to inspect.
 Rather than trying to read through the code to find an element, we can also do the opposite — we can locate a piece of code by hovering over the page element itself.
To do this, click the Element select icon in the top left corner of the panel:   Next, click a page element.
You’ll see the source code revealed in the inspect panel.
 6.
Edit the element's text, if desired.
 Besides viewing, we can use the inspect tool to alter the page contents.
Let’s start by swapping out some text.
 First, find some text content in the source code.
Then, right-click the element and choose Edit Text — this opens an inline text input in which you can write whatever you want.
When you deselect the text input, you’ll see the changes take effect:   Or, what about no text at all?
Just select the element in the source code and delete it.
The H1 will be gone from the page.
  Don’t worry though — it will reappear when you refresh the page.
 7.
Hide and edit elements on the page.
 You can also hide any element without deleting it by right-clicking the element in the source code and choosing Hide element .
 You can even add new page elements — right-click on an element in the source code and choose Edit as HTML .
You’ll see a text field where you can paste HTML.
For example:    8.
Edit the page's CSS code.
 Moving down the Chrome inspect panel, we see the Styles tab.
This shows us what CSS styling has been applied to the selected element.
Click on lines of code to rewrite them, or activate/deactivate certain declarations by checking/unchecking the boxes next to them.
Let’s do this for our <h1> element’s font-weight property:   9.
View the page's mobile version.
 Finally, let’s cover one more feature of Chrome’s inspect feature, mobile view.
When building a site, designers need to consider how its pages appear on desktop, mobile, and tablet screens alike.
 Fortunately, Chrome lets you preview the same web page in multiple screen resolutions.
Start by clicking the Toggle device icon in the top left corner of the panel:   From here, set the screen resolution manually or choose a device preset from the menu, then see how the page layout responds.
You can also rotate the screen and even preview performance at “mid-tier mobile” and “low-tier mobile” speeds.
        How to Inspect Element on Mac   To inspect an element on Mac, open up Safari.
Select Safari > Settings > Advanced, then toggle the option that reads Show Develop menu in menu bar.
Then, access your desired webpage, right-click, and tap Inspect Element.
     Let's look at how to inspect a page on Mac in more detail below, including tips and tricks.
We'll be using Safari, but technically you can also inspect a page on macOS by using Chrome or Firefox.

 Access now     Learn more           How To Inspect Elements in Safari  Safari includes a tool, just like Google Chrome, that allows you to inspect a web page.
Here's how to use it.
 1.
Enable Safari's developer tools.
 To use Safari’s inspect tool, Web Inspector, we first need to enable Safari's developer tools.
Here's how:   On the top menu, select Safari > Preferences .
 Tap Advanced.
  Check the box next to Show Develop menu in menu bar .
 You’ll see a Develop option added to the menu above.
  2.
Go to your desired web page.
 Next, go to the web page you'd like to inspect.
For this example, I'll be using HubSpot.com again.
 3.
Open up Web Inspector.
 There are three ways to open Web Inspector in Safari:   Option 1 : Right-click any part of the page and choose Inspect Element .
Right-clicking a specific page element will open that element in the inspector view.
 Option 2: Choose Develop > Show Web Inspector from the top menu bar.
 Option 3: Use the shortcut command-option-I .
  3.
Change the location of the inspect panel.
 Safari’s inspector opens at the bottom of the window by default.
 To change this configuration, click the icon to dock the display on the right side or pop out in a separate window.
 Both are located next to the X icon in the top left corner of the display.
  4.
Look at the source HTML and CSS code of the page.
 Safari’s inspector panel has two columns.
The first shows the source HTML, and the second shows the page CSS.
 Use your cursor to explore the source HTML and see which lines of code correspond to each page region.
Blue highlights the contents, green highlights the padding, and orange highlights the margins.
  5.
Select a specific element to inspect.
 We can also inspect the page directly.
Click the element selection icon at the top of the panel:   Now, when you click a page element, Web Inspector reveals the corresponding source code.
 6.
Edit, add, or delete page elements.
 Like Chrome’s inspector, Safari lets us modify, add, and remove page elements.
To edit the page, right-click an HTML element in the inspect panel, then choose an option from the Edit menu.
Web Inspector will prompt you for new text input, then display your changes in real-time:   Or, add a new element to the page by right-clicking a line of code and choosing an option from the Add menu.
In this example, I’ve added a new <h1> child element to an existing <div> :   If you want to delete a page element, simply select some code and delete it.
Or, right-click and choose Toggle Visibility to hide an element without deleting it.
 7.
Activate or deactivate the page's CSS code.
 To the right we have the Styles column, where we can change or activate/deactivate CSS declarations for any element, like so:   When testing content and style changes, you’ll want to see the effect on mobile screens as well as desktops.
We cover that next.
 9.
View the page's mobile version.
 Safari’s Responsive Design Mode allows you to preview a website across common devices.
 To view the page in a mobile viewport, choose Develop > Enter Responsive Design Mode .
In this mode, you can use the same inspector tools on pages formatted for Apple devices, or set the dimensions yourself:    How To Inspect Elements in Firefox  Firefox is another great option for inspecting a web page in either macOS, Windows, or Linux.
Here's how to get started:  1.
Open Firefox's inspect element tool.
 To open the Firefox Inspector, you have several options:   Option 1: Right-click any part of the page and choose Inspect Element .
Right-clicking a specific page element will open that element in the inspector view.
 Option 2: Select Tools > Web Developer > Inspector from the top menu bar.
 Option 3: Use the shortcut control-shift-C in Windows or command-option-C in macOS.
  2.
Go to your desired web page.
 Next, go to the web page you'd like to inspect.
I'll be using HubSpot.com again.
 3.
Change the location of the inspector panel.
 The Firefox inspector appears along the bottom of the window by default.
To change its position, select the three-dots icon in the top right corner of the inspector, then choose an alternative display option.
  4.
Look at the HTML code of the page.
 Firefox’s inspector panel is comparable in features to Chrome’s and Safari’s.
The HTML source code indicates the corresponding page element with color codes — content is blue, padding is purple, and margins are yellow:   5.
Select a specific element to inspect.
 You can also find code by selecting elements on the page.
To enter selection mode, click the cursor icon in the top left corner:   Click any page element to reveal its source code in the inspect panel.
 6.
Modify or delete page elements.
 To modify or delete a page element, select its code in the inspector.
Then, either double-click to change the text, or right-click and choose Edit as HTML or Create New Node to add code.
Or simply delete the code and see the resulting changes on the page.
   7.
Toggle the page's CSS styles.
 To toggle the CSS styling of an element, use the Filter Styles region at the bottom of the inspect panel.
Uncheck the box next to a CSS declaration to deactivate it (or write in new code yourself):   9.
View the page's mobile version.
 Finally, Firefox’s tools also come with a mobile preview option.
To use it, click the Responsive Design Mode icon in the top right corner of the panel:   Responsive Design Mode lets you choose from several preset screen resolutions or set your own, and you can also toggle connection speed and device pixel ratio:   Get a Closer Look With Inspect  Once you learn the basics of your browser’s inspect tool, you might realize just how much information about your favorite websites is publicly available.
With a few clicks, you can explore how exactly web pages are built, what styles they use, how they optimize for search engines, how they format on mobile screens, and a lot more.

"   I don't blame you.
 A few years ago, the rare times I ended up on devtools was because I accidentally pressed something on my keyboard.
I would frantically look for the "X" icon, thinking that it was only a matter of time before I broke something on my computer.
Then, let out a sigh of relief once I found the "X," as if there had been a secret countdown ticking away.
 For context, I did theater for years, so I always lean toward the dramatic.
  Turns out, devtools aren't nearly as intimidating as they seem.
While they're designed for developers, marketers, designers, and other non-developers can also use them to run audits and test website changes.
 Let's cover the various ways to use Chrome DevTools and go through some steps to optimize your website.
 What are developer tools?
 Developer tools, often called devtools, allow you to inspect, test, and debug code on a browser that impacts the user interface.
Marketers, SEO specialists, and designers can also use devtools to test changes and optimize their webpages.
 Before we get into how to use Chrome DevTools, let's cover a few things you should know:   HTML, CCS, and JavaScript run on browsers so they are the three languages that you will work with on Chrome Developer Tools.
 Anyone can use browser devtools and manipulate the code .
However, the changes will only appear on your browser and will be gone once you refresh the page.
Browser devtools help you identify what changes you need to make.
To make those changes permanent, you'll have to go access the code on the back end.
    How To Open Chrome Developer Tools    Right-click to inspect the page.
 The Chrome DevTools window will open.
 Click on each tab to access the tools.
     1.
Right-click to inspect the page.
  Right-click on the webpage you want to inspect.
As a shortcut, you can also press "Command+Option+C" on Mac or "Control+Shift+C" on Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS.
Then, click on "Inspect."  2.
The Chrome DevTools window will open.
  Navigate each panel by clicking on the tab located on the top of the screen.
Jump to this section for an overview of the top devtools.
 3.
Click on each tab to access the tools.
  Once you're done using Chrome DevTools, you can close it by clicking on the "X" symbol located on the top right of the window.
 How To Use Chrome Developer Tools Without Coding Experience    Most web browsers have their own developer tool kit and there's a lot of overlap in the features.
On Chrome DevTools, here are the top features:   A device preview to test your webpage's responsive design  A JavaScript debugger to identify and fix bugs  A network panel to track and analyze page requests  An inspector tool to make styling changes, such as font, spacing, colors, margins  A console to identify page errors and warnings  A p erformance panel to check your website performance, such as page speed   Here are a few ways to use Chrome Developer Tools.
 Test your responsive design with Mobile Chrome Developer Tools.
 The Toggle Device Toolbar on Chrome DevTools allows you to see how your webpage looks on various devices, including iPhone models, iPads, and laptops.
You can even add custom dimensions if a particular device isn't featured in the list.
  During an initial web development phase or a redesign, this toolbar can help your team visualize how your page renders on different viewports.
 It can be especially useful to assess the user experience on your page.
 For instance, say your data tells you that on mobile, users spend half the time on your blog posts than they do on desktop.
When comparing one post on mobile versus desktop, you may find that the paragraphs are too long and bulky, creating a negative reading experience.
 The easy fix here would be writing shorter paragraphs and adding more visuals to break up the text.
 Using this same toolbar, you can also test how users with a slower connection experience your page loading.
  "No throttling" means there is no interruption on the connection.
A mid-tier to low-end mobile will take longer to show all the elements on the page.
If you're completely offline, you'll see the "no internet" error code.
 Why is this useful?
You want your users to have a positive experience on your site, no matter their connection.
By seeing how your page loads, you may identify areas for improvement.
 Measure and optimize your site speed.
 For this step, we'll be using Lighthouse , an open-source Google product that evaluates webpage performance and presents opportunities for improvement.
You can run it on Chrome DevTools to test everything from site speed and SEO to accessibility on both mobile and desktop.
  Page speed plays a big role in your ranking and should be a top priority when running an SEO audit.
 To check your page speed using Lighthouse, refer to the picture above.
Select "Performance" and whichever device you want to test on.
Then, click on "Generate report." Once the results display, focus on the "Speed Index."   A good or fast speed index is between 0 and 4.3 seconds.
A moderate one will fall between 4.4 and 5.8 seconds.
If your index is over 5.8 seconds, your page is slow and will need some fixes to improve the page speed.
 Another section to pay attention to as you scroll down is "Opportunity," this will list ways to reduce your page load speed.
  In addition to impacting your SEO, page speed can also lead to high bounce rates.
If you want to reduce your page loading time, the Lighthouse tool is a great place to start.
 Preview your design changes.
 If your team wants to visualize how certain aesthetic changes will look on your website, a quick and easy way is by using the inspector tool to manipulate the code.
 To get started, click on your "Inspect" tool.
  Then, hover around any element on the page to get details on the page styling.
  To make changes to the styling, select the element you want to edit.
The "Elements" panel will jump to that element's HTML and CSS code.
The "Styles" tab is what you want to focus on.
  Here's an example of how to change the text color.
  Run an SEO audit.
 Every brand wants to rank on search engines because it means reaching more people and getting more traffic to your site.
 To make sure your website maintains a high position, conduct regular audits to catch anything that could cause your page to drop in ranking.
With Chrome DevTools, you can run an audit on Lighthouse to check what could be affecting your ranking.
 To start, click on the Lighthouse tab.
Select "SEO" under categories and the device you'd like to focus on.
Then, click "Generate report."   The report will show you your successful audits and opportunities for improvement.
  Although this SEO audit is not comprehensive, it's a great place to get a quick overview of your site's SEO performance.
 Monitor your Google Analytics requests.
 If you're tracking your website and marketing campaigns on Google Analytics, the last thing you want is dirty data.
 Using Chrome DevTools, you can monitor the requests from Google Analytics and see if they are correctly reported on the Analytics Dashboard.
Doing so will ensure you're collecting accurate data and help you identify errors.
 Here are the steps:   Click on the "Network" tab.
 Load your webpage.
 Find the Google Analytics requests, they will always begin with "__utm.gif"  Click on the request to see what information is included in the request.
  Once you know where to look, Chrome Developer Tools can be pretty easy to use.
While some coding knowledge is helpful, it's not necessary to have success with the tool.

To make a positive impact on visitors and influence more sales, it's essential to decide on the colors you want to use intentionally.
Your color palette should reinforce your brand, make your site easy to read and navigate, and — above all — look good.
  But, finding colors that “look good” together isn’t as easy as it sounds.
Many factors contribute to how we process color on a visual and emotional level .
This makes it difficult to create an effective and original website color scheme from scratch, even if we have some intuitive sense of which color combinations work well and which don’t.
  Best Colors for a Website  Unfortunately, there is no universal color combination that is the secret to leads and sales from your website and design collateral.
If only it were that simple (but, at the same time, all visual imagery would be pretty much the same as a result).
 Instead, there are two things you should consider as you choose the colors for your website:   Color theory - How colors and visuals interact with each other to create an aesthetically pleasing design.
 Color psychology - How the colors you choose can change the perception of your brand psychologically.
  In essence, color theory helps you choose colors that work well together (like avoiding putting pink text on a purple background because that will hurt the readability of your site) while color psychology can help you create a subversive vibe (like choosing blue for a calming effect).
 One HubSpot designer had this to say about choosing a color for your website or brand: "The long story short is to choose a color that resonates with your brand, its values, and target audience.
Blue can be associated with trust and security, while red can be passion and excitement.
Don't fall into the trap of picking a unique color because it's 'trendy'.
Pick something that is versatile in nature."  One thing that you can do is start with a single color or mood and work backward from there to create your color scheme.
Alternatively, you can get inspiration from your favorite brands that are already doing it.
Luckily, we’ve curated a list of some of the best color combinations used in web design that you can try out yourself.
   Best Website Color Schemes & Combinations    Coral Red and Viking  East Bay, Moon Raker, and Ghost  Viking and Karry  Tan Hide, Vermilion, and Acapulco  Botticelli, Nepal, and Ship Gray  Persian Green, Vista Blue, Mauvelous, and Sunflower  Marigold Yellow, Ice Cold, and Vista Blue  Spice, Tuscany, Jaffa, Calico, and Yellow Metal  Swiss Coffee, Schooner, Pharlap, and Mine Shaft  Tulip Tree and Punga  Swans Down, Monte Carlo, and Observatory  Your Pink, Bittersweet, and Alizarin Crimson  Pampas, Your Pink, and Melanie  Mountain Meadow and Magnolia  Terracotta, Gun Powder, Moon Raker, Acapulco, and Manhattan  Bittersweet, Cosmos, Nile Blue, and Seagull  Malibu, Aero Blue, Picton Blue, and Boston Blue  Navajo White and Vivid Tangerine  Dove Gray and Aero Blue  Milano Red and Black Pearl      Of course, a group of mysterious color names isn’t much help without seeing them in action.
(What is “Pharlap,” anyway?)  So, for each scheme, I’ve provided the hex color codes for each color in the color combination as well as a visual example of how they can work together.
All examples are pulled from websites acclaimed for their visual appeal.
Feel free to use these sites as inspiration for your color palette, layout, and overall aesthetic.
 1.
Coral Red and Viking   Coral Red: #F93943  Viking: #7EB2DD   Viking is a subtle pale blue that provides a soothing breath of fresh air to any site.
Adding splashes of coral red provides a shock of contrast without overdoing it on saturation.
The example below also adds additional blues and greens for a cool oceanic vibe broken up by the splashes of coral.
Consider making the red paler if this particular shade of coral is too dramatic.
  Image Source  2.
East Bay, Moon Raker, and Ghost   East Bay: #424874  Moon Raker: #DCD6F7  Ghost: #CACFD6   If you've ever been bored by text elements in predictable blacks and dark grays, East Bay is a dark blue that makes a great alternative.
Swap white backgrounds with the pale gray of Ghost for fancier white space.
Then add pale accents like Moon Raker lavender for a soft palette or opt for high-saturation accents like the pink in the example below.
  Image Source  3.
Viking and Karry   Viking: #7EB2DD  Harry: #FFE8D4   Okay, we can't get enough of the pale blue that Viking provides.
And, speaking of soft palettes, pairing it with a soft creamsicle color like Karry makes for a soothing feel in pastel complementary colors.
 The example below takes the palette even further with Viking and Karry's starker, more saturated counterparts as accent colors.
  Image Source  4.
Tan Hide, Vermilion, and Acapulco   Tan Hide: #F98866  Vermilion: #FF420E  Acapulco: #80BD9E   If you love oranges but are seeking something more vibrant than Karry, Tan Hide and Vermilion are beautiful sunset-like colors.
 In some cases, they can be a little overwhelming, so be sure not to overdo it.
Consider cooling them off with a soothing color like the pale green of Acapulco.
  Image Source  5.
Nepal, Ship Gray, and Botticelli   Nepal: #90AFC5  Ship Gray: #3E363F  Botticelli: #C4DFE6   Ship Gray is another fantastic alternative to boring black text with its super dark contrast.
This plays out well when paired with the pale blue-grays of Nepal and Botticelli.
 In the example below, they’ve added a lovely orange to this palette for the occasional pop of color.
  Image Source  6.
Persian Green, Vista Blue, Mauvelous, and Sunflower   Persian Green: #00A6A6  Vista Blue: #98DBC6  Marvelous: #F18D9E  Sunflower: #E6D72A   When done well, this color scheme accosts the monitor or page with dramatic color without being too harsh.
The green, coral, and yellow are soft yet disarming.
 In the example below, they're used liberally, giving a summer vibe of candy or popsicles.
  Image Source  7.
Marigold Yellow, Ice Cold, and Vista Blue   Marigold Yellow: #F6E278  Ice Cold: #BCF4F5  Vista Blue: #98DBC6   Marigold Yellow and Vista Blue (which is really more of a pale green) are warmer colors that contrast nicely with the temperature difference of the Ice Cold blue despite being an analogous color scheme.
The result is subtle but fun color shifts.
  Image Source  8.
Spice, Tuscany, Jaffa, Calico, and Yellow Metal   Spice: #6E352C  Tuscany: #CF5230  Jaffa: #F59A44  Calico: #E3C598  Yellow Metal: #6E612F   Pastels not your thing?
Embrace the strong reds of Spice and Tuscany and the dusky yellows of Jaffa and Yellow Metal.
They provide a hot, spicy feel to any design.
In addition, with Calico, you can have a bright contrast without resorting to white, which may be too cool for the palette.
  Image Source  9.
Swiss Coffee, Schooner, Pharlap, and Mine Shaft   Swiss Coffee: #E1DCD9  Schooner: #8F868  Pharlap: #A67F78  Mine Shaft: #3E3C3C   Brown can be an extremely versatile color as shown by this monochromatic set of colors ranging from Swiss Coffee (lightest) to Mine Shaft (darkest).
 Limited color schemes can be very attractive on minimalist sites.
In addition, you can make designs with a light mode (light base and dark text) or dark mode (dark base and light text like in the example below).
  Image Source  10.
Tulip Tree and Punga   Tulip Tree: #F2AB39  Punga: #563C16   Tulip Tree is a deep, saturated mustard color that makes a big statement.
Combining it with a dark tinted orange like Punga (which almost presents as more of a dark brown) creates a rich experience on any design.
Just look at how UPS uses this scheme with expert color blocking and visually appealing texture.
  Image Source  11.
Swans Down, Monte Carlo, and Observatory   Swans Down: #D1EDE1  Monte Carlo: #7BC5AE  Observatory: #028C6A   Minty fresh! Another monochromatic palette, this time with the pale green of Swans Down and Monte Carlo with the darker tint of Observatory.
White goes well with this scheme, as do contrasting oranges or corals.
  Image Source  12.
Your Pink, Bittersweet, and Alizarin Crimson   Your Pink: #FFC2C3  Bittersweet: #FE7773  Alizarin Crimson: #EA3238   These three colors are all strong pinks heavy on the red hue.
With that in mind, they provide a bold, in-your-face type of look.
The example below uses this to its advantage by making Bittersweet the primary color.
The effect is further emphasized with a cool white and an electric blue as accent colors.
  Image Source  13.
Pampas, Your Pink, and Melanie   Pampas: #F1EBE9  Your Pink: #FFC2C3  Melanie: #E6CBDD   Another combination with the bold Your Pink color, this one leans into a bubblegum-type theme with the lighter Pampas and Melanie colors.
  Image Source  14.
Mountain Meadow and Magnolia   Mountain Meadow: #1B998B  Magnolia: #F8F1FF   Green and pink aren't exactly complementary colors, so you don't see them paired often.
In addition, Mountain Meadow and magnolia don't have the same hue or tint.
However, this unconventional pairing works because it subverts expectations.
However, because Magnolia is so light and leans toward the cooler side of pink (almost like a pinkish periwinkle), it doesn’t completely clash with the green.
  Image Source  15.
Terracotta, Gun Powder, Moon Raker, Acapulco, and Manhattan   Terracotta: #E07A5F  Gun Powder: #3D405B  Moon Raker: #DCD6F7  Acapulco: #80BD9E  Manhattan: #F2CC8F   This combination of pastels with the deep, saturated dark purplish blue of Gun Powder creates a soft but trendy and bold scheme.
Terracotta, Moon Raker, Acapulco, and Manhattan make excellent choices for colored backgrounds (as shown below) with Gun Powder as contrast for text and navigational elements.
  Image Source  16.
Bittersweet, Cosmos, Nile Blue, and Seagull   Bittersweet: #FE7773  Cosmos: #FFD8D8  Nile Blue: #194049  Seagull: #87CEEB   The pale blue of Seagull and pale pink of Cosmos go well with the bold coral of Bittersweet and the dark Nile Blue (which presents as a dark bluish emerald).
 For a bold look, make the latter the primary colors in the design with the softer ones as subtle accents.
 Alternatively, you can go for a more understated look with softer backgrounds and pops of bold color.
  Image Source  17.
Malibu, Aero Blue, Picton Blue, and Boston Blue   Malibu: #4DD7FF  Aero Blue: #AEFFF1  Picton Blue: #32C3EE  Boston Blue: #3B8FA1   Check out this semi-monochromatic color combination composed of blues.
Aero Blue and Boston Blue have a hint of green tint, though, to make things visually interesting instead of minimalist.
  Image Source  18.
Navajo White and Vivid Tangerine   Navajo White: #FFE0AC  Vivid Tangerine: #FF8C8C   Vivid Tangerine is a dramatic red-pink color that makes a statement on its own.
Paired with an understated yellow like Navajo White or even a more saturated yellow, it provides a warm look as bright as the sun.
 In the example below, no extra imagery or textures are needed as the colors are loud enough to speak for themselves.
  Image Source  19.
Dove Gray and Aero Blue   Dove Gray: #666666  Aero Blue: #AEFFF1   But if cool is more your speed and you want to retain a bit of eye-searing boldness, Aero Blue is a good option.
The dramatic aqua can be paired with a toned-down Dove Gray as well.
  Image Source  20.
Milano Red and Black Pearl   Milano Red: #BA1200  Black Pearl: #031927   Red is hard to do well in web design, but the more muted Milano Red is easier to work with.
It gets even easier with Black Pearl, a blue so dark that it presents as a black with cool undertones.

Image Source  Adding a Splash of Color  At first, it might seem like finding the right color combination should be easy and intuitive.
After all, we see effective uses of color all around us, from brand design , to art and entertainment, to fashionable outfits.
The truth is, all of these real-world designs have been carefully planned, tested, and at least partially inspired by designs that came before.
 Creating the perfect color design for your website is a challenge.
But, by sticking to one of the schemes I’ve provided, your site will serve as another fine example of quality web design in action.

 Download for Free          Updated: 08/11/22   Published: 05/27/21        When it comes to designing or redesigning a website , it’s easy to get hung up on the aesthetics.
Does that shade of blue look right?
Should the logo be on the right side of the screen, or left?
What if we put a giant animated GIF in the middle of the page?
  However, in a world where folks have more than 1.8 billion websites they can potentially land on, you need to make sure yours is not just a pretty face .
It should be designed for usability , how easy your website is to use, and user experience (UX) , how enjoyable it is to interact with your website.
 Now, you could spend years studying the ins and outs of these disciplines But for the sake of giving you a jumping-off point, we've assembled a list of the fundamental guidelines and best practices you can apply to your next website redesign or website launch .
Then, we’ll review 10 features you’ll need on your site to put these recommendations into practice.
Let’s dive in.

        1.
Simplicity  While the appearance of your website is certainly important, most people aren't coming to your site to evaluate how slick the design is.
They want to complete some action, or to find some specific piece of information.
 Therefore, unnecessary design elements (i.e., those which serve no functional purpose) will only overwhelm and make it more difficult for visitors to accomplish what they're trying to accomplish.
 From a usability and UX perspective, simplicity is your best friend.
If you have all the necessary page elements, it’s hard to get too simple.
You can employ this principle in a variety of different forms, such as:   Colors: Basically, don't use a lot.
The Handbook of Computer-Human Interaction recommends using a maximum of five (plus or minus two) different colors in your design.
 Typefaces: The typefaces you choose should be highly legible, so nothing too artsy and very minimal script fonts, if any.
For text color, again, keep it minimal and always make sure it contrasts with the background color.
 A common recommendation is to use a maximum of three different typefaces in a maximum of three different sizes.
 Graphics: Only use graphics if they help a user complete a task or perform a specific function (don't just add graphics willy-nilly).
  Here's a great example of a simple but effective homepage design from HERoines Inc :   Image Source  2.
Visual Hierarchy  Closely tied to the principle of simplicity, visual hierarchy means arranging and organizing website elements so that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements first.
 Remember, when it comes to optimizing for usability and UX, the goal is to lead visitors to complete a desired action, but in a way that feels natural and enjoyable.
By adjusting the position, color, or size of certain elements, you can structure your site in such a way that viewers will be drawn to those elements first.
 In the example below from Spotify , you can see that the main heading “Get 3 months of Premium for free” sits atop the visual hierarchy with its size and page position.
It draws your eye to their mission before anything else.
This is followed by the "Get 3 Months Free" CTA, which prompts action.
Users can click this CTA, or scan the menu items above for more actions.
  Image Source  3.
Navigability  Planning out intuitive navigation on your site is crucial to help visitors find what they're looking for.
Ideally, a visitor should land on your site and not have to think extensively about where to click next.
Moving from point A to point B should be as frictionless as possible.
 Here are a few tips for optimizing your site's navigation:   Keep the structure of your primary navigation simple (and near the top of your page).
 Include navigation in the footer of your site.
 Consider using breadcrumbs on every page (except your homepage) so users remember their navigation trail.
 Include a search bar near the top of your site so visitors can search by keywords.
 Don't offer too many navigation options per page.
Again, simplicity!  Include links within your page copy, and make it clear where those links go.
 Don't make users dig too deep.
Try making a basic wireframe map of all your site pages arranged like a pyramid: Your homepage is at the top, and each linked page from the previous forms the next layer.
In most cases, it’s best to keep your map no more than three levels deep.
Take HubSpot’s site map, for example.
   Image Source  One more pointer: Once you've settled on what your site's main (top) navigation will be, keep it consistent.
The labels and location of your navigation should remain the same on every page.
 This leads us nicely into our next principle...
 4.
Consistency  In addition to keeping your navigation consistent, the overall look and feel of your site should be similar across all of your site's pages.
Backgrounds, color schemes, typefaces, and even the tone of your writing are all areas where consistency has a positive impact on usability and UX.
 That's not to say every page should follow the same layout.
Instead, create different layouts for specific types of pages (e.g., landing pages, informational pages, etc.).
By using those layouts consistently, you'll make it easier for visitors to understand what type of information they're likely to find on a given page.
 In the example below, you can see that  Airbnb uses the same layout for all of its "Help" pages, a common practice.
Imagine what it would be like from a visitor's perspective if every "Help" page had its own, unique layout.
There would probably be a lot of shoulder shrugging.
  Image Source  5.
Responsivity  According to Statista , 48% of page global views were from mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.
And according to our research , 93% of people have left a website because it didn’t display properly on their device.
 The takeaway here: To provide a truly great user experience, your site has to be compatible with the many different devices that your visitors are using.
In the tech world, this is known as responsive design .
 Responsive design means investing in a highly flexible website structure.
On a responsive site, content is automatically resized and reshuffled to fit the dimensions of whichever device a visitor happens to be using.
This can be accomplished with mobile-friendly HTML templates, or by creating a special mobile site.
 Ultimately, it's more important to provide a great experience across different devices than look identical across those devices.
  Image Source  Alongside mobile-friendliness, it’s worth your while to test your website’s cross-cross browser compatibility.
In all likelihood, you’ve only viewed your site on one web browser, be it Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or something else.
 Now is the time to open your pages on each of these browsers and evaluate how your elements appear.
Ideally, there won’t be much difference in presentation, but you can’t know for sure until you see for yourself.
 6.
Accessibility  The goal of web accessibility is to make a website that anyone can use, including people with disabilities or limitations that affect their browsing experience.
As a website designer, it’s your job to think of these users in your UX plan.
 Like responsiveness, accessibility applies to your entire site: structure, page format, visuals, and both written and visual content.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) , developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative and the World Wide Web Consortium, set the guidelines for web accessibility.
In a broad sense, these guidelines state that websites must be:   Perceivable: Visitors are aware of the content on your site.
 Operable: The functionality of your website should be possible in different ways.
 Understandable: All content and alerts can be easily understood.
 Robust: Your website is usable across different assistive technologies, devices, and browsers.
  For a deeper dive into this topic, see our Ultimate Guide to Web Accessibility .
 7.
Conventionality  A big challenge in web design is balancing originality with your expectations.
Most of us are expert internet users, and there are specific conventions we’ve grown accustomed to over time.
Such conventions include:   Placing the main navigation at the top (or left side) of a page.
 Placing a logo at the top left (or center) of a page.
 Making the logo clickable, so it always brings a visitor back to the homepage.
 Having links and buttons that change color/appearance when you hover over them.
 Using a shopping cart icon on an ecommerce site.
The icon also has a number badge signifying the number of items in the cart.
 Ensuring image sliders have buttons users can click to manually rotate slides.
  While some might opt to throw these out the window for the sake of uniqueness, this is a mistake.
There’s still plenty of room for creativity within the constraints of web conventionality.
 Let’s briefly consider another field of design, architecture.
Building codes are put in place so that folks can easily and safely inhabit spaces.
An architect doesn’t complain about these codes or violate them because, aside from legal repercussions, they assure safety and comfort of guests.
It doesn’t matter how dazzling the building looks — if you trip on uneven stairs or you can’t get out in a fire, you might prefer to stay outside.
 In the same way, you can craft a memorable experience while meeting user expectations.
If you violate what users anticipate, they may feel uncomfortable or even frustrated with your site.
 8.
Credibility  Sticking to web conventions lends your site credibility.
In other words, it increases the level of trust your site conveys.
And if you're striving to build a site that provides the best user experience possible, credibility goes a long way.
 One of the best methods to improve your credibility is to be clear and honest about the product or service you're selling.
Don't make visitors dig through dozens of pages to find what it is you do.
Be up-front on your homepage, and dedicate some real estate to explaining the value behind what you do.
 Another credibility tip: Have a pricing page, also linked on the homepage.
Rather than force people to contact you to learn more about pricing, list your prices clearly on your site.
This makes your business appear more trustworthy and legitimate.
 Here's an example of an effective pricing page from the Box website :   Image Source  9.
User-Centricity  At the end of the day, usability and user experience hinge on the preferences of the end-users.
After all, if you're not designing for them, who are you designing for?
 So, while the principles detailed in this list are a great starting point, the final key to improving the design of your site is to conduct user testing, gather feedback, and implement changes based on what you've learned.
 And don’t bother testing usability by yourself.
You’ve already invested a lot of time into your design, which brings your own biases into the equation.
Get testers who have never seen your site before, the same as any first-time visitor.
 Here are a few user testing tools to get you started:   Website Grader : Our free tool evaluates your website based on several factors: mobile, design, performance, SEO, and security.
It then offers tailored suggestions for improvement.

 Hopefully, these guidelines are useful in informing the structure of your web pages and website as a whole.
But, how does one put these guidelines into practice?
Let's take a look at some actionable best practices you can follow during the design process.
   Website Design Best Practices    Select a typography that’s easy to read and skim.
 Choose a color scheme that suits your brand.
 Use white space to break up text and other elements.
 Use texture to add personality and depth.
 Add images to engage and inform readers.
 Simplify your navigation.
 Make your CTAs stand out.
 Optimize for mobile.
 Limit the options presented to users.
     1.
Select a typography that’s easy to read and skim.
 Typography refers to how type — meaning letters and characters — are arranged and presented on the page.
Since website typography affects not only how we read but how we feel about text on a web page, it’s important to pick carefully.
 Ideally, you want a typeface that is:   easy to read  easy to skim  accessible to all users  legible across multiple devices and screen sizes   You also want it to match the look and feel of your brand.
For example, the luxury fashion brand Burberry refreshed its logo for the first time in 20 years in 2018.
It replaced the old serif typeface with a bold, all-caps, sans serif typeface and dropped the knight emblem.
The result is a simpler and more modern-looking logo that’s easier to read on any screen — and that reflects changes in the company to become more transparent and appeal to a younger generation.
  Image Source  2.
Choose a color scheme that suits your brand.
 Like typography, color can affect not only how we understand and interact with content, but how we feel about it.
Your color scheme should therefore check off the same boxes as your website typography.
It should:   reinforce your brand identity  make your site easy to read and navigate  evoke emotion  look good   Buzzfeed, for examples, uses the primary colors yellow and red to grab users' attention and get them excited about the content.
It reserves the use of the primary color blue — which is associated with trust — exclusively for links and CTA buttons.
Both emotions are ideal to evoke for a media site.
  Image Source  3.
Use white space to break up text and other elements.
 Whitespace refers to the negative areas in any composition.
Whitespace provides users with visual breaks as they process a website’s design or content, which is not only aesthetically pleasing.
By minimizing distractions, whitespace makes it easier for users to focus, process information, and understand what it’s important.
 That means you can use whitespace to avoid causing information overload or analysis paralysis — and to emphasize important elements on the page.
This might help persuade users to take a specific action, like sign up for a newsletter, shop your latest collection, and more.
 For example, Eb & flow Yoga Studio uses whitespace to lead users toward a specific action: to sign up for three weeks of classes.
Notice that whitespace doesn’t mean the absence of color or imagery.
Instead, it means that every element on the page is positioned strategically, with lots of space in between, to avoid overwhelming or confusing visitors.
  Image Source  4.
Use texture to add personality and depth.
 Resembling a three-dimensional, tactile surface, web textures aim to replicate the physical sensation of touch with another sensation — sight.
They’re a great design alternative to solid color backgrounds, particularly if you want to add personality and depth to your site.
 Take a look at the texture on the homepage for the Santa Barbara-based restaurant Mony’s Tacos below.
It looks like chalk drawn on a blackboard, doesn’t it?
I don’t know about you but I can almost feel the chalk on my fingers just from looking at it.
It's the perfect look for a restaurant that aims to be California's preferred Funk Zone choice for Mexican delights.
  Image Source  5.
Add images to engage and inform readers.
 Striking a balance between text and images is essential in website design.
Incorporating visuals can make your content more informative, engaging, and memorable.
You’ve probably heard the statistics that people remember only 20% of what they read, but 80% of what they see ?
While the exact percentages are debated, the basic idea isn’t.
It’s easier for some people to learn and process information visually.
 Here's a unique example of breaking up text with images from a cosmetic company's website.
This shows how endless the possibilities of incorporating imagery into your website design are.
  Image Source  6.
Simplify your navigation.
 Navigation is one of the most important design elements on a website.
It impacts whether visitors arrive on your homepage and browse, or click the “Back” button.
That’s why it’s important to keep it as simple as possible.
 Many websites opt for a horizontal navigation bar.
This navigation style lists the major pages side by side and is placed in the website header .
 Take the navigation bar on Blavity as an example.
The sections featured include three content categories — “News,” “Op-Eds,” and “Lifestyle” — as well as links to their submission page and sign-up page.
This provides visitors with easy access to the pages they’re likely looking for.
Other nav items are placed in a dropdown menu labelled "More" so they're still easy to find but not cluttered into the top-level navigation.
Finally, the navigation bar is sticky so visitors won’t have to scroll up and down the page to browse the site.
  Image Source  7.
Make your CTAs stand out.
 CTAs are elements on a web page, advertisement, or another piece of content that encourages the audience to do something.
The call to action could be to sign up, subscribe, start a free trial, or learn more, among many others.
 You want your CTAs to pop in your website design.
To make that happen, consider how you’re using color as well as other elements like background color, surrounding images, and surrounding text.
 Square provides an excellent call-to-action example .
Using a single image to showcase the simplicity of using their product, Square uses bold typography to also show how unique and future-oriented their product is.
Against this dramatic backdrop, the blue "Get Started" CTA awaits your click.
 Image Source  8.
Optimize for mobile.
 We’ve already discussed how important it is for your website to be responsive.
But since mobile devices accounted for 59% of organic search engine visits in 2021, we’re doubling down on how important it is to design your website to be mobile-friendly.
That might mean altering or removing some elements that would clutter smaller screen sizes or negatively impact load time.
 For an example of one of the best mobile website designs , compare Etsy’s homepage on desktop vs mobile.
On desktop, you’ll see a navbar with categories.
Hovering over each category will reveal a dropdown menu.
  Image Source  On mobile, this collapses behind a hamburger button, which improves the appearance and performance of the mobile site.
You'll also notice that the images are larger — perfect for tapping with your finger on a mobile screen.
  9.
Limit the options presented to users.
 According to Hick’s Law , increasing the number and complexity of choices will increase the time it takes for a person to make a decision.
This is bad news in website design.
If a website visitor is presented with too many options, they might get frustrated and bounce — or they might pick an option you don’t want, like abandoning their cart.
That’s why it’s important to limit the number of options presented to a user.
 For example, a visitor landing on the homepage of Shawn Michelle's Ice Cream will have three options: to learn more about the company, the flavors, or the ingredients.
But instead of presenting all three options at the same time, they are presented one at a time in a slider.
This is a great example of implementing Hick’s Law in UX design.
 Image Source  Pro-Tip: Don't have the time to follow the rules?
You can always download a pre-built website template that will provide a sound foundation for your site.
 Now we understand the principles and best practices that should guide you throughout the design process.
In the next section, let's run down the essential page elements that you should strongly consider including in your design plan.
     Website Design Requirements    Header and Footer  Menu Navigation  Search Bar  Branding  Color Palette  Headers  Clear Labels  Visuals and Media  Calls to Action (CTAs)  Whitespace       1.
Header and Footer  The header and footer are a staple of just about every modern website.
Try to include them on most of your pages, from your homepage , to your blog posts, and even your “No results found” page .
 Your header should contain your branding in the form of a logo and organization name, menu navigation, and maybe a CTA, and/or a search bar if well-spaced and minimal.
On the other end, your footer is where many users will instinctively scroll for essential information.
In your footer, place contact information, a signup form, links to your common pages, legal and privacy policies, links to translated versions of your site, and social media links.
 2.
Menu Navigation  Whether it’s a list of links across the header or a tidy and compact hamburger button in the corner, every website needs a guide for navigation positioned at the top of at least your homepage and other important pages .
A good menu limits the number of clicks to reach any part of your website to just a few.
 To reduce clutter, you might consider making some or all menu options a dropdown menu with links within it, as can be seen on HubSpot's homepage .
  3.
Search Bar  In addition to menu navigation, strongly consider placing a search bar at the top of your pages, so users can browse your site for content by keyword.
If incorporating this functionality, make sure your results are relevant, forgiving of typos, and capable of approximate keyword matching.
Most of us use a high-quality search engine every day, be it Google, Amazon, YouTube, or elsewhere.
These all set the standard for your own site search.
 4.
Branding  Remember the conventions we’ve discussed?
One that you see practically everywhere is a logo in the top left corner.
On first landing, many visitors’ eyes will instinctively shift to this region to check they’re in the right place.
Don’t leave them hanging.
 To reinforce this notion, incorporate your company branding into every element you add, piece of content you post, and color scheme you create.
That’s why we recommend establishing brand guidelines if you haven’t already — check out our style guide for a reference.
 5.
Color Palette  Color choice plays a major role in your site’s usability and UX as well.
This decision tends to be more subjective than other requirements in this list.
But, like everything else we’ve discussed, try to simplify — limit your color selection to 3-4 prominent colors at most.
 Starting a color palette from scratch can be surprisingly difficult the first time.
We seem to intuitively pick up on which colors work well together and which don’t, but we stumble when trying to pick from the infinite combinations available.
 The solution?
Try a color palette that’s been shown to work on other websites.
Take influence from your favorite sites, and see our list of our favorite website color schemes to get started.
 6.
Headings  Headings are key to establishing the visual hierarchy we discussed earlier, especially on text-heavy pages.
As users skim your pages what you need, a clear and to-the-point heading alerts readers to stop scrolling after finding what they want.
Use only as many headings as there are distinct sections of your page, as too much blown-up and bolded text will dampen this effect.
 7.
Clear Labels  Whenever a user takes an action on your website, it must be obvious exactly what they’re doing and/or where they’re going.
All buttons should have clear text or an icon to precisely and concisely signal their purpose.
The same goes for in-text links and widgets (simple interactive elements, like dropdowns and text forms).
 For example, a button linking to a pricing page should just read “Pricing” — anything beyond that (e.g., “See our prices”, “Check out the pricing page for a deal”) is superfluous.
A search bar/button only needs a search glass icon (🔍), and perhaps also the word “Search”, to denote its purpose.
 User testing can be a major help here.
While you yourself know what all of your interactive page elements do, the same can’t be said for a new user.
Testing will give valuable insight into what users think your labels mean beyond your own perspective.
 8.
Visuals and Media  When incorporating static images, gifs, videos, and other media into your pages, remember to be consistent and intentional in your choices.
These elements will draw attention over most other text and will likely stay in users’ minds, so choose wisely.
 Here’s just one example of effective media on a homepage.
Notice how every image complements the page aesthetic and supports the offer of personalized fitness training with results.
  Image Source  Also, all images and videos should be optimized for search engines and include descriptive alt text for accessibility.
 9.
Calls to Action (CTAs)  Having a pleasing website is great, but how do you know whether your visitors are actually doing what you want?
Are they engaging with your content?
This is where CTAs come into play.
 A CTA is any page element that prompts user action.
The action could be adding a product to a card, downloading a content offer, or signing up for an email list.
Make your CTA elements prominent in the visual hierarchy (remember our Spotify example), but not intrusive or distracting like many click-through ads tend to be.
 If you need ideas for sleek CTAs that drive more conversions, see our CTA examples list .
 10.
Whitespace  As mentioned above, sometimes it’s about the elements you don’t include.
After reading these guidelines and requirements, you may feel tempted to stuff your pages with all the bits and bobs needed for a flawless UX.
Don’t forget that your viewers need room to digest all this new info, so give your elements room to breathe.
 But, how much whitespace should you have?
That’s another personal call, and varies from site to site.
So, user testing is handy here as well.
What are people focusing on?
Do they feel overwhelmed with the density of content?
Once again, it all ties back to our first guideline, simplicity.
 Design that Puts Users First  Indeed, web design is largely subjective — your website’s look and experience isn’t going to please everyone.
However, there are also tried-and-true UX principles that, when carefully considered and incorporated, help visitors feel more at home.
 According to Amazon Web Services , 88% of website visitors are less likely to return to a website after a poor experience.
And how could you blame them?
We’ve surely all been there.
 So, as a final bit of usability/UX wisdom, start caring more! Imagine yourself into the shoes (or, more accurately, browser windows) of your visitors, and keep them in mind every step of the design process.

All you need to do is find and use the right resources.
   However, with what feels like endless options, that’s easier said than done.
 If you don’t know where to start or are looking to expand on your back-end skill set, keep reading.
We’ve gathered our favorite back-end web development tools.
   Front-End Tools vs.
Back-End Tools    What does a back-end developer do?
   25 Best Back-End Web Development Tools     Front-End Tools vs.
Back-End Tools  If you’re new to building websites, you might be wondering what we mean when we talk about front-end tools and back-end tools.
 Front-end tools are the programming languages that you use to implement the look and feel of your website, as well as wrangle user experience aspects such as drop-down menus or mobile views.
Front-end tools include:    HTML    CSS    JavaScript    JSON    Back-end tools, on the other hand, are the languages, servers, and other tools needed to write the software underpinnings of a website.
Depending on the features of the website there is a good chance that even simple software has been written to power it under the hood.
 Back-end development tools make sure that the software engine of the website operates as expected, and that all of the bits of code talk to each other properly.
Becoming an agile web developer means learning how to operate and function in a variety of web ecosystems that employ both back-end and front-end code.
 Back-end developers are responsible for writing APIs, developing information architecture, and anything that has to do with reading and writing information onto a server.
  What does a back-end developer do?
 You might be wondering what a back-end developer does.
With the breadth of skills they employ, you might also be wondering whether or not they are just another flavor of engineer.
 The short answer: Where engineers are concerned with the bigger picture and problem-solving, developers are more concerned with the day-to-day maintenance and deployment of a website or application.
 If you’re considering becoming a back-end developer, here are some areas you might be responsible for in your future role.
   Writing code.
Perhaps a given, but you’ll be living in code.
   Building websites.
Today, every business needs a website.
The longevity of this career choice is second to none.
You’ll build everything from ecommerce platforms to blogs to media empires.
   Troubleshooting existing code.
Sometimes issues arise, as they do in any field.
You’ll be tasked with checking out and solving bugs.
   Testing code for quality.
Also known as QA or quality assurance testing, developers are responsible for making sure their code can pass muster long after it’s deployed.

   In this post, we’ll check out 30 of my favorite successful uses of CSS animation.
As someone who spends a lot of time studying websites and how they capture visitors’ attention, I know a good animation when I see one, and I’m stoked to share them with you.
 But first, a brief review of the topic at hand ...
 How do CSS animations work?
 CSS animation is a feature of CSS that allows you to animate a change in one or more style properties of an element .
Pure CSS animations require no additional code (e.g. JavaScript) or media (e.g. GIFs) — everything is done with HTML and CSS.
 To make a simple CSS animation, you need three things: an HTML element to animate, a CSS rule that binds the animation to this element, and a group of keyframes that defines the styles at the start and end of the animation.
You can also add declarations to further customize your animation, like speed and delay .
 To demonstrate, here’s a simple example of a CSS animation:  See the Pen CSS Animation Example by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  In this CSS keyframes animation, div is the element we’re animating.
Looking at the CSS, we see that the animation declarations are associated with the div selector.
The most important declaration here is animation-name , which binds the keyframe my-animation to our div element.
Below this are several additional declarations that affect the timing and behavior of the animation.
 The animation itself is created with a keyframe, indicated by the @keyframes rule.
A keyframe defines the animation’s starting state (inside from{ } ) and its end state (inside to{ } ).
The keyframe my-animation changes three style properties of our div: background-color , width , and top .
When these three properties are animated at once, it produces a coherent animation.
 In our example, we only have one keyframe.
Documents with multiple types of animations may have multiple keyframes, each bound to a different element.
 CSS Keyframe Animation Examples  Below, we’ve compiled examples ranging from basic interaction effects to works of art (at least according to me).
These examples are from CodePen , a website for creating and sharing code snippets in HTML and CSS.
If you’re in need of inspiration, CodePen is a great place to help get the creative juices flowing.
 We’ll start with examples that use the traditional keyframes approach described in the section above.
These examples are, generally, easier to replicate in your own projects.
 1.
Simple Loading Spinners  CSS animations can be used to create effects that we’re all familiar with — these spinning load icons are one such example.
Their meaning is almost universally understood, and they’re light on code as well.
This particular example also shows how to achieve a similar effect with a scalable vector graphic .
 See the Pen Simple HTML & SVG Loading Spinners by Stephen Delaney ( @sdelaney ) on CodePen .
  View the code here .
 2.
Simple CSS Loaders  Here are some more loading animations to try out, presented in a handy grid.
Each one is smooth and elegant, so you can pick out the ones that most appeal to you.
 See the Pen Simple CSS loaders by Jenning ( @jenning ) on CodePen .
  3.
Rotating Changing Shapes  Here’s a good example to dissect for practice — notice how each of the transitions applies at different keyframes throughout the animation:  See the Pen CSS Animate by Matthew Dordal ( @mdd ) on CodePen .
  4.
Scrolling Text Animation  Another cool way to enhance your text, this code snippet applies a slot-machine-like effect that rotates words in and out of view.
This is a common technique on websites that need to convey the versatility of their creations.
Is your product efficient, user-friendly, and sustainable?
Plug those words into an animation like this one.
 See the Pen Text animation by Yoann ( @yoannhel ) on CodePen .
  View the code here .
 5.
Animated Submit Button  I always enjoy the small, unexpected delight moments that savvy designers like to sprinkle throughout their web pages.
This submit button is a clean, pleasing way to provide visual feedback indicating that an action has been completed, such as a form being submitted.
 See the Pen Submit Button pure css animation by Dead Pixel ( @dead_pixel ) on CodePen .
  6.
Hot Coffee  The snippet below shows how simple, stripped-back animations can go a long way.
In this case, applying CSS animation to translation, scale, and opacity fade adds life to an otherwise basic drawing.
 See the Pen Hot Coffee by Zane Wesley ( @zanewesley ) on CodePen .

Coffee Machine  We love our coffee on the HubSpot Blog, so here’s another.
In this case, the animation doesn’t steal focus.
Rather, it enhances the design around it to make the whole element feel more immersive.
It’s something users will just barely notice, but appreciate regardless.

Button Wiggle  Need to draw a user to a CTA?
In lieu of a color flash or a modal, consider adding a quirky wiggle effect to a button like this one.
I like that this effect can capture attention without seeming invasive or significantly disrupting the visitor’s flow.
Instead, it’s playful and friendly.

Pacman  I don’t recommend placing this one on your site for risk of copyright infringement, but it’s fun to watch.

Three Dots Loading  Another instance of CSS animation being used to create a loading effect that many of us are familiar with.
A simple scale change is all that’s needed to say, “Just a moment, please.”  See the Pen CSS Loader with dots by Aliaksei Peterson ( @petersonby ) on CodePen .

 11.
Never-ending Box  Evoking Sisyphus, this animation shows a box continuously trying to climb a slope, only to inevitably fall back down.
I could see this being used as a loading animation — imagine the animation ending with the box toppling over the other side.
So satisfying!  See the Pen Never-ending box by Pawel ( @pawelqcm ) on CodePen .
  12.
Color Fan  I think this next example works especially well for design-centric business websites — try animating your color palettes to create a fan-out effect, and change things up from basic colored squares.
 See the Pen Color Palette with Pure CSS Animation by Nitish Khagwal ( @nitishkmrk ) on CodePen .
  13.
Ants On a Sugar Cube  If you’re not a fan of bugs, I won’t be offended if you skip this one.
It’s a clever implementation of animation on the left , bottom , and transform properties.
All the keyframes are doing is changing the location of each “ant” SVG element.
 See the Pen Ants on Sugar CSS Animation by Stephen Fairbanks ( @thathurtabit ) on CodePen .
  14.
3D Toggle Switch  The toggle switch is a staple of UI design.
This example puts a three-dimensional spin on the concept, complete with a smooth animation for the toggling state.
Here, the developer has modified the CSS checkbox input element into something more interesting.

Submarine  CSS works well for flat, colorful illustrations and animations.
The code below combines several effects to draw a — quite frankly — adorable submarine.
The only change I would suggest is making it yellow to honor the Beatles.

Animated Title Text on Hover  Olivia Ng’s “Hover Effect for Headers” example explores several ways to add dynamism to the title text.
It shows how just a couple of keyframes can elevate your headings.

Minimal Cat  I like that this example makes clever use of negative space combined with some well-timed CSS animations.
It’s a simple design that conveys a lot of personality with the CSS transform property alone.

Growing/Shrinking Bars  CSS animations can help add flair to data visualizations.
This example shows how colors and speed can create different feels for dynamic bar graphs — CSS animations let you change the speed and number of repetitions in your animations.

 19.
Twisting Squares  Here’s a deceptively simple example that creates a trippy effect.
The same rotation effect is applied to all the square divs on the page.
Their differences in size cause them to rotate at different speeds, creating the illusion.
 See the Pen Twisty by Mike King ( @micjamking ) on CodePen .
  20.
Laser Tag  I’ll say that this is one of the more complex examples in this list.
However, it makes for a unique and captivating loading display to hold attention for a brief period.

Candles  I love this brilliant example of how CSS animations can tell a story.
You’ll likely need a lot of practice to pull something like this off, but it’s sure to stick out to those visiting your site for the first time.

Speedy Truck  Chris Johnson’s “Speedy Truck” makes smart use of parallax to simulate a truck’s drive through a natural setting.
While minimal in appearance, this pen packs in details with several creative uses of the transform property — there’s even a little bump in the road.

 23.
Snow Globe  The coziest example we could find, this snow globe animation, adds an ambiance to your page that you won’t get with a still image.
Notice how the snow animates only within the confines of the “glass” globe.

 Other CSS Animation Examples  Here are some more examples that don’t use keyframes (or use them very minimally) for animations.
Instead, they leverage other more complex techniques to achieve the effect.
 24.
Floating Image  The “floating” effect is a subtle, simple, and effective use of animation.
In this case, it’s used to display an icon with excellent results.

CSS Mouse Hover Transition Effect  This animation shows a simple but effective text highlight effect triggered by a mouseover action .
I think it’s a great way to add some extra style to your page links.

Hover-Responsive Logo  Check out the logo in the bottom right corner of the pen below — this animation applies a subtle animation on mouse-hover.
It’s another visual cue for users that makes navigating your website a tad more enjoyable.

 27.
Rotating Text  Okay, this example is cheating a bit since it uses JavaScript.
However, imagine this on a homepage.
Its transitions are incredibly smooth, and you have the option to customize which effects you use to transition between different words.
 See the Pen Rotating Text by alphardex ( @alphardex ) on CodePen .
  28.
Opening Envelope  One of my favorite examples, this elegant animation pays close attention to detail.
From the downward movement as the envelope opens, to the details on the paper, to the shadow underneath, it’s clear how small touches add up to one smooth, coherent animation.
This would make a great button or scroll animation.
 See the Pen Animated CSS Mail Button by Jake Giles-Phillips ( @jakegilesphillips ) on CodePen .

 29.
File Drawers  To liven up your menus, consider something like the pure CSS file drawers below.
Its cabinets open slightly on mouse hover, helping your primary navigation stand out from others.

 30.
Astronaut  Here’s another smart use of the floating effect, paired with a friendly out-of-this-world illustration.
Yet another instance of a subtle CSS animation effect to enhance the feel of a page element.

  View the code here .
 One Final Example  As we’ve seen, just a touch of CSS animation can go a very long way in crafting a more immersive experience for your visitors.
The best animations serve your content and experience without distracting or appearing gimmicky — all of the above examples strike this balance remarkably well.
 However, we couldn’t resist adding one last example that blew us away.
This “Watch Tower” example is probably beyond the scope of this piece in its complexity, but it’s also a testament to what CSS and HTML alone can accomplish.

Click to start the journey          Unleash the hidden beauty of neurodivergents There are a lot of stigmas around the neurodiverse, especially in the workplace.
Yet hidden in these individuals are unique perspectives that might transform the workplace.
What is neurodiversity?
An understanding that there are variations in the human brain and that these variations are natural, not an illness, and does not automatically disable someone.
These variations might affect the way someone thinks, feels, and socializes, learns, focuses, and a variety of other cognitive processes.
Learn to see things from their perspective Understanding the spectrum Neurodivergents are individuals with less typical cognitive variation (autism, dyslexia, or ADHD).
These variations usually fall in a spectrum where the autistic and dyslexic brains sit at opposing ends while neurotypicals (individuals with more common brain function) sits in the middle of the spectrum.
Autism The autistic brain structure creates for detail-oriented individuals usually with good memorizing abilities.
This means in viewing a tree, they might easily see the details on every tree, but struggle to see the tree or the forest.
Dyslexia The dyslexic brain structure makes for individuals who see the bigger picture better; conceptual thinkers.
They could easily understand the forest, but might miss details on the trees.

Contact Us     Web Textures: How to Add an Extra Dimension to Your Website    Download Now: Free Website Redesign Workbook        Jamie Juviler     Updated: December 03, 2021   Published: September 15, 2020       When we talk about web design, we tend to discuss the things that visitors directly focus on: color palettes , images, typography , and well-placed branding, just to name a few.
  However, here I want to discuss a more understated technique for your website design tool belt, one that gives context to your content and personality to your pages without stealing the user’s attention.
Let’s talk about texture.
 Web textures are a great design choice if you want to elevate your website’s pages beyond plain solid colors while conveying personality and engaging more visitors.
 So, in this guide, I’ll explain what web textures are and why they’re effective.
I’ll also share tips for adding them to your website and provide you with some of the best web texture resources to get started for free.
    What are web textures?
  In web design, a web texture is a visual element, typically a background image, that resembles a three-dimensional, tactile surface.
Web textures serve to enhance the look and feel of a website by giving web pages personality and depth.
    Web textures are a unique web design method because they aim to replicate one of our physical sensations, touch with, another, sight.
By presenting a 3D backdrop for your page elements, they induce something of a haptic sensation through the visual medium of our computer screens.
 This all has an interesting effect on our brains — it evokes emotions that we associate with the real world.
Think of lying in the grass on a summer afternoon, or the tiny craters on a piece of construction paper.
Web textures try to replicate that life-like feeling in the digital world.
 Types of Textures Used in Web Design  Web textures come in many varieties to evoke a range of feelings and experiences.
It’s useful to classify web textures in terms of two factors: realism and prominence.
 Realism refers to how closely a texture resembles a real-world texture.
This can range from abstract designs, like a color gradient or geometric pattern, to real-world tangibles like grass, carpet, or linen.
This is similar to the concept of skeuomorphism — the more realistic a texture appears, the more we associate it with our real-life experiences, which makes the page more immersive.
 Prominence refers to how much a texture stands out against its fellow elements.
On one end, subtle textures are hardly visible, but still present enough to lend a sense of personality and warmth.
On the other end, loud textures immediately bring attention to that region of the page and firmly establish the personality of a website.
 I know I’ve talked a lot about textures without examples, so let’s look at some now.
 First, here’s an abstract, subtle web texture.
You’ve seen gradients like this all over, since they’re a great way to engage visually with minimal distraction.
  Here’s an abstract and loud web texture.
The sharp corners certainly stand out more than a smooth gradient.
This polygonal design in particular might be associated with the digital space, making it suitable for, say, a tech startup.
  Here’s a realistic and subtle texture.
If you look closely, you can make out a linen-like or paper-like surface.
When simply browning a website, however, you may not notice this on a conscious level.
These types of textures are very common on websites because they can convey emotions related to real-life without users’ realizing.
  Finally, here’s a loud, realistic texture — you don’t need to squint to know this is concrete.
Bold and lifelike designs like this leave no ambiguity as to the purpose of your website.
Use these textures with caution, as they have high potential to clash with accompanying two-dimensional elements.
  Web Textures vs.
Patterns  You might have noticed that I’ve been avoiding using the word “pattern” to describe web textures.
That’s because “texture” and “pattern” mean slightly different things in web design, even though you might see these terms used interchangeably in your research.
 Patterns are small and repeating images.
When you see a pattern on a web page, you can probably make out the “tile” which constitutes the pattern.
For example:   With textures, on the other hand, it’s more difficult to discern a repeating image, often because entire background textures are composed of a single detailed and complex image with no exact repeats.
See the difference?
  Why Do We Use Textures in Web Design?
 As with just about any other design element, effective web textures go beyond making a page look interesting.
Web textures can serve two primary functions on your site: conjuring feelings and drawing attention.
 Conjure Feelings  Great design accounts not just for what users see, but also for what they don’t see.
I’m talking about visual elements that most users don’t consciously register but affect their browsing experience nonetheless.
 Web textures are great at doing this — they can make viewers feel positive emotions and associate them with your brand.
For example, an outdoors company could implement a grass, night sky, or snowy texture.
A tech company can opt for a geometric abstract texture.
A bakery texture might add a sprinkle of, well, sprinkles to their texture.
It all depends on the personality you want to communicate and the real-world associations you want to make for visitors.
 For example, this quirky spin-off site for a Vancouver-based digital agency capitalizes on the power of texture perfectly.
The entire site, including its buttons, is overlain with a felt-like texture, invoking a cozy feeling associated with returning home for the holidays.
  Image Source  When used correctly, a web texture helps visitors feel immersed in your website experience, like walking through a store, rather than just peering through a browser window.
 Guide the Eye  Web textures can also influence our browsing experience on a subconscious level by directing our gaze to certain areas of a web page.
When applied to a page region, element, image, or text, web textures pull our attention toward these things by contrasting with the surrounding page.
 This French design agency accents the featured image on their homepage with a basic green marble texture.
Many of us associate marble with art displays, museums, luxury, and prestige, making it a fitting texture choice in this instance.
  Image Source  Farther down the page, additional images are set against the same marble texture for a coherent scrolling experience.
  Image Source  Think about what parts of the page you want users to see or click, and if you can apply textures to them.
These page sections might be product descriptions, headers, calls to action, or buttons.
Strategic placement of certain textures helps to create a path that new visitors will follow while learning about your offers and taking action along the way.
 In a similar vein, web textures can also serve to reinforce your page structure.
Contrasting textures work well at separating different areas of content, which keeps your info-heavy pages more digestible and engaging.
   How to Use Texture in Web Design    Don’t overdo it.
 Keep text legible.
 Match your intended feeling.
 Balance image quality with load time.
     It’s one thing to find a texture that looks good, but implementing it tastefully into your pages takes a bit more thought.
To pull off a web texture that draws users in, be sure to follow these four key guidelines:  1.
Don’t overdo it.
 As with any aspect of website design, limit your use of textures to the essentials.
Remember that web textures are there to support your main content, not replace it.
Too much texture is bound to distract and even overwhelm users.
 Start by thinking about what you want your web texture to accomplish.
Should it appear in the background, as a section divider, in your headers, or elsewhere?
Understanding the purpose of your textures will help you be more intentional with their use and keep you from going overboard.
 Subtle, simple textures are easier to add without diverting users’ attention, so I recommend trying these first and adjusting if you feel in need of something bolder.
Also, keep the number of textures on your website to two when starting out, and add more later if you’d like.
 Above all, your texture should add some personality and guide attention to what matters most, your content.
 2.
Keep text legible.
 I’m surprised at the number of websites I’ve seen on which text is overshadowed by a textured background.
There’s little point in directing attention to text content if the words themselves are illegible, and few things pull visitors out of the experience more quickly.
It’s another reason to aim for simplicity in your textures, especially those behind text.
 Much of this is common sense — don’t put yellow on a white texture or dark purple on black texture.
From an accessibility perspective, though, it’s also a good idea to run your pages through a color-blindness web page filter like this one .
That way, you’ll ensure your textures and text work for all readers.
 3.
Match your intended feeling.
 The ability to subconsciously induce feelings is a powerful thing, which is why any web texture option you apply needs to match your brand’s identity closely.
You don’t want mixed messaging when it comes to emotion.
 If you’re going for a realistic texture, it’s likely apparent which textures best match your company’s image: Grass implies outdoors, sprinkles imply baked goods, etc.
 For more abstract designs, however, the most logical texture choice might not be so clear, especially with thousands of options out there.
 The solution to this is simple user testing.
Run your test site by a diverse audience and see how subjects react to different textures.
Be mindful of the emotions your textures bring, and users will feel welcomed.
Neglect it, and you could lose their trust.
 4.
Balance image quality with load time.
 Our last tip is more about performance than aesthetics.
Web textures most often come in the form of large images, which can affect the loading time of your uncached web pages.
Try to find the highest-quality texture(s) you can while minimizing their impact on page load speed.
 Again, this will require testing on your part — blurry textures and slow load speeds both detract from the user experience.
Still, an engaging web texture is worth a very slightly decreased performance, and incorporating other solutions to reduce load time can make this a non-issue.

  Image Source  Taking On Some Texture  Despite a recent push toward two-dimensional web design in recent years, web textures have held their place thanks to their positive impact on user engagement, experience, and enjoyment.
 After understanding the purpose of your textures, I encourage you to plan out how you want them implemented.
Then, play around with different texture types and test which performs best on your website, all while adjusting the realism and prominence of the designs.
With some trial and error, you can bring a new meaning to the “look and feel” of your site.

          The Storytelling Process           Storytelling Resources                     What is storytelling?
  Storytelling uses words to create new worlds and experiences in a reader or listener's imagination.
Storytelling can impact human emotions.
It can also lead people to accept original ideas or encourage them to take action.
    Since storytelling can take so many forms, creating a good story can be challenging.
Here are some quick do’s and don’ts to get you started:    The Art of Storytelling   Since the dawn of human language, storytelling has been how cultures pass on shared beliefs and values.
Some of the stories told today come from stories our ancestors were shared over 6,000 years ago .
 Every person has a story, but the art of storytelling can make a story transformative.
There are a few qualities that can push a basic story into the art of storytelling.

 Access now     Learn more           Narrative  All great stories have a narrative, which is a spoken or written account of events that are influenced by a setting.
 For example, stand-up comics tell stories during a set, and while the structure, setting, and details of the narrative may not feel the same as they do in a Shakespeare play, both share a narrative.
 Attention-Grabbing  Just telling a story isn’t enough — you want one that resonates and grabs attention.
 One great way to do so is to create suspense which attracts audiences with unanswered questions and an interest to learn more and answer those questions.
Surprising your audience is also a great way to pull readers in.
 Another way is to “Show, don’t tell,” where you captivate with details that bring your story to life.
 For example, say your company is launching a new product.
You can share details about when your team came up with the idea, which is more exciting than telling customers you’re about to release the best new product.
Talk about the roadblocks and small wins; make your audience feel part of your process.
 Interactive  Storytelling isn’t just the story you tell — it’s how your audience responds and engages.
Some kinds of storytelling require people to participate in the story, like the Netflix interactive show Kaleidoscope , where viewers customize the order they watch episodes.
 But with most stories, the interaction comes from the relationship the audience builds with the storyteller.
Your audience might be a fan group for the latest Harry Potter movie.
And your favorite storyteller could be a TikTok influencer.
 That feeling of connection and interaction is essential to storytelling.
 Imaginative  Many movies come from popular books, and it's not unusual for viewers to rate the quality of a book-based movie on its ability to match what they imagined as they read the book.
 When someone listens to storytelling, they might develop a visual for the story in their mind, and it can be incredibly detailed and include the characters, setting, and events.
Stories can pull up memories, and people might see themselves represented in story characters.
 Telling a story is essentially painting a picture.
While everyone can tell a story, you can fine-tune your storytelling skills and become a storyteller for your organization, brand, or business.
These people are typically marketers, content writers, or PR professionals.
 Every member of an organization can tell a story.
But before we get into the how, let’s talk about why we tell stories — as a society, culture, and economy.
  Why Do We Tell Stories?
 Some of the main reasons to tell stories are to sell, entertain, and educate.
But why choose storytelling over a data-driven PowerPoint or a bulleted list?
Why are stories are a go-to way of sharing, explaining, and selling information?
 Here’s why.
 Stories solidify abstract concepts and simplify complex messages.
 Understanding new ideas can be confusing; stories can offer a way around that.
 Think about times when stories have helped you better understand a concept.
Maybe a teacher used a real-life example to explain a math problem, or a speaker used a case study to convey complex data.
 Stories help solidify abstract concepts and simplify complex messages.
 Taking a lofty, non-tangible concept and making it relatable using concrete ideas is one of the biggest strengths of business storytelling.
 Take Apple , for example.
Computers and smartphones can be complicated topics to describe to everyday consumers.
The business uses real-life stories to explain exactly how its products work and benefit users.
It uses storytelling instead of relying on technical jargon to convince consumers to buy its products over a competitor.
 Stories promote and shape ideas.
 Peoplehave used stories to promote cooperation and influence social behaviors throughout history.
Listening to stories also engages different parts of the brain than data does.
 And there is scientific evidence that stories can change our behavior because they engage our emotions.
If you’re good at storytelling, you might influence the future behavior of your audience by asking someone to see a series of events from your perspective.
 For example, even if you’re still stressed out and overwhelmed, you can still connect with a story, and a connection might lead you to be less critical about facts, less defensive, and more open to changing your ideas.
 Cultures often honor skilled storytellers because they also appreciate brands that tell stories to promote societal values, like this example of Ben & Jerry’s supporting the People’s Response Act .
  Image Source  Stories bring people together.
 Stories are a universal language; they can bring people together and create a sense of community.
Despite any barriers and differences, stories connect us through feelings and how we respond to them.
 We all understand the story of the hero, the underdog, or heartbreak.
We all process emotions and can share feelings of elation, hope, despair, and anger.
Sharing a story gives even the most diverse people a sense of commonality and community.
 Image Source  TOMS is a great example of this.
It shares stories of customers and the people it serves and has effectively created a movement that has driven sales and built a community eager to support TOMS and view its impact on the causes it supports.

 When brands get transparent and authentic, it brings them down-to-earth and helps consumers connect with them and the people behind them.
 Tapping into people’s emotions and bearing both the good and bad is how stories inspire, motivate, and drive action.
Stories also foster brand loyalty by creating a narrative around your brand or product that humanizes it while marketing your business.
 Few brands use inspiration as a selling tactic, but ModCloth does it well.
Sharing the real story of its business makes the brand relatable and worth purchasing and inspires other founders and business owners.
  Image Source   What makes a good story?
 Words like good are bad are relative to opinion, but there are a few non-negotiable components that make up all great stories.
 Good stories are:   Entertaining : Good stories keep the reader engaged and interested in what’s coming next.
 Believable : Good stories convince the reader of their version of reality and make it easy to trust and engage.
 Educational : Good stories spark curiosity and add to the reader’s knowledge bank.
 Relatable : Stories remind readers of the people and places they know and help audiences recognize patterns in the world around them.
 Organized : Good stories follow a succinct organization that helps convey the core message and helps readers absorb it.
 Memorable : Whether through inspiration, scandal, or humor, good stories stick in the reader’s mind.
(As a reference, consumers say that funny content is the most memorable .)  Trendy: These stories relate to current events and buzzy topics that people are engaged with, building your brand's presence as an informed and active participant in current events.
This could look like using trending memes in Tweets.
  How to Tell Great Stories   According to HubSpot Academy’s free Power of Storytelling course , a good story has three main components — regardless of the story you’re trying to tell.
 1.
Characters  Every story features at least one character, and this character is key to relating your audience back to the story.
The main character is the protagonist.
 Your characters form the bridge between you, the storyteller, and the audience.
If your audience can put themselves in your character’s shoes, they’ll be more likely to follow through with your call-to-action.
 2.
Conflict  The conflict is the lesson of how the character overcomes a challenge.
Conflict in your story elicits emotions and connects the audience through relatable experiences.
When telling stories, the power is in what you convey and teach.
If there’s no conflict in your story, it’s likely not a story.
 3.
Resolution  Every good story has a closing.
Your resolution should wrap up the story, give context to the characters and conflict(s), and leave your audience with a call to action.
 If you’re new to storytelling, there are a couple of other elements you’ll want to think about as you build your first story.
 4.
Structure  Your plot is the structure of your storytelling.
 A blog can have great writing and relatable characters.
But if you don't create a natural flow of events, your blog will confuse your reader.
 A blog can have excellent writing and relatable characters, but lacking a natural flow can confuse your reader.
 For example, your “About” page on your website can run through your business’ story, but if you don’t break it into useful segments, your visitors might bounce before they get to the good part.
 Plots don't need to be in chronological order, and there are many ways to experiment with the structure of your story .
But all stories should have a beginning, middle, and end.
 5.
Setting  Your story's setting is more than where a story takes a place.
It's how you can:   Share the values and goals of your characters  Shift the tone of conversations and action  Make it easier to show instead of tell   For example, say you're creating an ad campaign that features two main characters.
One runs a small startup and the other works for a large enterprise.
Where would it make sense for these two to meet up?
How could their location impact the conversation?
 These factors affect how audience absorb, understand, and relate to the story.
  The Storytelling Process  We’ve explained that storytelling is an art that requires creativity, vision, and skill.
It also requires practice.
Enter: the storytelling process.
 Painters, sculptors, dancers, and designers all follow their own creative processes when producing their art.
It helps them know where to start, how to develop their vision, and how to perfect their practice over time.
The same goes for storytelling – especially for businesses writing stories.
 But, why is this process important?
Because, as an organization or brand, you likely have a ton of facts, figures, and messages to get across in one succinct story.
How do you know where to begin?
Well, start with the first step.
You’ll know where to go (and how to get there) after that.

Know your audience.
 Who wants to hear your story?
Who will benefit and respond the strongest?
To create a compelling story, you need to understand your readers and who will respond and take action.
 Before you put pen to paper (or cursor to word processor), do some research on your target market and define your buyer persona(s) .
This process will get you acquainted with who might be reading, viewing, or listening to your story.
Understanding who your story is for will also offer crucial direction as you build out the foundation of your story.
 It’s not that you can’t get by with a more basic understanding of your target audience; it just won’t help you go above and beyond in sharing stories your audience is interested in, wants to hear, and stories that inspire them.
Our 2023 Marketing Trends Report found that, more than ever, data-driven marketers will win.
 Leveraging data can help you better reach your target audience, understand the most compelling stories, drive high ROI with your stories, and generally create better and more engaging and desired content.
 2.
Define your core message.
 Like the foundation of a home, you need to set up your core message before moving forward.
 Is your story selling a product or raising funds?
Explaining a service or advocating for an issue?
What is the point of your story?
To help define this, try to summarize your story in six to ten words.
If you can’t do that, you don’t have a core message.
 3.
Decide what kind of story you’re telling.
 Not all stories are created equal.
To decide what kind of story you’re telling, figure out how you want your audience to feel or react as they read.
 This will help you figure out how you’re going to weave your story and what goal you’re pursuing.
If your goal is to:  Incite Action  Your story should describe how you completed a successful action in the past and explain how readers might be able to create the same kind of change.
Avoid excessive, exaggerated detail or changes in the subject so your audience can focus on the action or change that your story encourages.
 Tell Your Story  Talk about your genuine, humanizing struggles, failures, and wins.
Today’s consumer appreciates and connects to brands that market with authenticity.
Your storytelling should reflect your authentic self.
 Convey Values  Tell stories that tap into familiar emotions, characters, and situations so readers can understand how it applies to their lives.
 Also, tell stories that convey your brand values, like causes you support and care for, whether directly or indirectly related to your brand.
For example, you can share a case study about the impact of a fundraiser you created or explain the environmentally-conscious production process for your products.
 It’s an essential type of story to tell, as consumers care more than ever about what the brands they buy from stand for and whether their values align.
They want to know about the causes you support and your commitments to bettering the world.
 If it seems like more of a niche type of story to share, it’s actually on the rise.
In fact, 44% of marketers are already sharing this type of content, and it has the 5th highest ROI of any trend .
 Foster Community or Collaboration  Tell stories that move readers to discuss and share stories with others, stories where people might say, “Hey, me too.” Stories that foster this kind of community building inspire audiences to continue to come back to your business and develop connections with you and other people that are also impacted.
 Conversations that people have will help you learn more about your audiences and what they care for so you can create content more relevant to their needs.
Community building is trending in marketing, and 90% of marketers say that building an active online community is crucial to success in 2023.
Consumers also want to join communities ( 20% have joined one in the past three months).
  Impart Knowledge or Educate  Educational content is anything that informs your audiences who are trying to solve problems, get an answer, or meet a need.
They want help figuring out what to do, and your educational content will help them get there.
 Popular types of content you can use to tell educational stories are blog posts and YouTube videos.
For example, You can tell a story with a trial-and-error experience for readers to learn about a problem and how you applied a solution.
This can help people facing a similar problem discover how to tackle it and expose you to new audiences who might be searching for resources to solve their issue but have yet to hear of you.
 Fun fact: Website/seo/blogs have the highest ROI of any marketing channel .
 4.
Establish your call-to-action.
 Your objective and call-to-action (CTA) are similar, but your CTA will establish the action you’d like your audience to take after reading.
 What exactly do you want your readers to do after reading?
Do you want them to donate money, subscribe to a newsletter, take a course, or buy a product?
Outline this alongside your objective to make sure they line up.
 For example, if your objective is to foster community or collaboration, your CTA might be to "Tap the share button below."  5.
Choose your story medium.
 Stories can take many shapes and forms.
Sometimes people read stories.
Other times they watch or listen., Your chosen story medium depends on your type of story as well as resources, like time and money.

 Access now     Learn more           Here are four different ways you can tell your story:  Writing  Written stories can be articles, blog posts, books — anything that’s mostly and primarily text.
Written stories are by far the most affordable, attainable method of storytelling as it can simply require a free word processor like Google Docs or a pen and paper.
 Speaking  You tell spoken stories in person, like in a presentation, pitch, or panel.
TED talks are an example of spoken stories.
Because of their "live", unedited nature, spoken stories typically require more practice and skill to convey messages and elicit emotions in others.
 Audio  Audio stories are spoken aloud but recorded — that’s what sets them apart from the spoken story.
Audio stories are usually in podcast form, and with today’s technology, creating an audio story is more affordable than ever.
(For great story-driven podcasts, check out The HubSpot Podcast Network .)  Digital  Digital storytelling comes in a variety of media formats like:   Videos (fun fact: short-form videos, like TikToks or Instagram Reels, have the highest ROI of any media format.
)  Animations  Interactive stories  Games  Images  Infographics   Digital storytelling is a highly effective format for emotionally resonant and active visual stories.
Given this, they can sometimes be expensive to produce and require higher budgets.
The great thing is that consumers often don’t mind lower video quality and production value as much as conveying a strong message.
 6.
Plan and structure your story.
 You have an idea of what you want to include in your story, how you want to organize it, and what medium is best.
If you were doing some creative writing, your next step might be to jump right into writing and work on the structure of your story later.
 But while storytelling in marketing is creative, it also has a goal in mind.
This means it may need a more structured process because every step from the intro to CTA needs to meet a specific goal.
 Your storytelling should ignite imagination and emotion no matter where you share it.
But marketing storytellers are also tracking metrics once their story goes out into the world.
 With this in mind, you may want to create a detailed outline of your story.
You might develop storyboards, wireframes, or a PowerPoint presentation.
These can help you stay focused as you craft your story.
They can also help you keep your original vision of your story as you move through the approvals, meetings, and pitches that often come with business storytelling.
 7.
Write!  Now it’s time to put pen to paper and start crafting your story.
For many storytellers, this is the fun part.
 As of this writing, there are over 218,000,000 links on Google for the search "writer's block." If you feel stuck, you're not alone.
But help is on the way.
 These excellent tips for writer’s block can help you if you feel stuck, and these quotes about storytelling can inspire you.
 Remember, you've got this.
Every person is a storyteller, and audiences aren't just waiting for any old story.
They want to hear from you.
 7.
Share your story.
 Don’t forget to share and promote your story.
Like with any piece of content marketing, creating it is only half the battle — sharing is how your audience can complete your story.
According to HubSpot Blog Research, here are some of the best ways and places to share your stories:  1.
Email  According to our Media & Content Planning Report , email marketing is one of the most leveraged channels used by media planners, and it has the 3rd highest ROI of any channel.
 2.
Social Media  Social media is the top marketing channel with the highest ROI, so sharing your stories on the platform is bound to bring engagement and interaction for your business.
The top platforms for sharing stories on social media are Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
 Many businesses also use a mix of organic and paid media to maximize the potential reach for their stories.
 3.
Blogs  Promote written stories on your blog, Medium , or by guest posting on other publications.
 4.
Video  According to marketers, video has the highest ROI of any media format, especially short-form video.
While spoken stories are best conveyed in person, consider recording a live performance to share later.
 The more places you share your story, the more engagement you can expect from your audience.

(Not to mention, using SVG files boosts your SEO efforts.)   With those potential outcomes, why are only 54% of websites using SVG files?
The truth is that image optimization online isn't easy.
Quality image resolution , responsive design , and animation can improve any website.
But if they're not done right, they can tremendously affect user experience and site speed — and not positively.
  In this post, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about SVG files.
You’ll discover how they work, why site owners use SVG files, and even pros and cons.
Let’s dive in.
  What is an SVG file?
 How SVG Files Work  What are SVG files used for?
 Where to get SVG files  Pros and Cons of SVG files  How to Make or Edit an SVG File  SVG Software      What is an SVG file?
  An SVG file, short for scalable vector graphic file, is a standard graphics file type used for rendering two-dimensional images on the internet.
SVG files store images as vectors and are known for generating crisp graphics while remaining optimized for search engines.

This file type is programmable, usually smaller than other formats, and even capable of dynamic animation.
  You might have noticed that a key differentiating factor is that SVG files store graphics as vectors.
That begs the question: What exactly is a vector image?
 Raster vs.
Vector Images  We can divide the image file formats used on the internet today into two categories: Raster and vector graphics.
 You’re probably familiar with common image formats, PNG and JPEG.
These are raster graphics formats, meaning they store image information in a grid of colored squares called a bitmap.
The squares in this bitmap combine to form a coherent image, much like pixels on a computer screen.
 Raster graphics work well for highly detailed images like photographs, where each pixel has a specific color.
Raster images have a fixed resolution, so increasing their size lowers the quality of the image.
 Vector-graphic formats — like SVG and PDF — are different.
These formats store images as a set of points and lines between points.
Mathematical formulas dictate the placement and shape of these points and lines and maintain their spatial relationships when the image is scaled up or down.
Vector graphic files also store color information and can even display text.
  How SVG Files Work  SVG files are written in XML , a markup language used for storing and transferring digital information.
The XML code in an SVG file specifies all the shapes, colors, and text that comprise the image.
  Let’s look at some examples.
I’ll start by drawing a simple circle SVG:   When I open the file for this circle in a text editor, this XML code appears:   As you can see, there’s not much code here.
We only need one line of code to draw a circle.
That’s because XML does most of the work for us with tags .
In the code above, tags are shown in pink within angle brackets.
 To draw the circle, the XML code specifies the shape with a <circle> tag, its position with the and with the cx and cy attributes, the radius with the r attribute, and the color inside the <style> tag.
#f4795b is the hexadecimal color code for this particular shade of orange.
 When provided with an SVG file like this, a web browser (or other application) takes in this XML info, processes it, and displays it onscreen as a vector image.
All modern browsers render SVGs this way, as can specialized graphics editing software.
 You’ll also notice that this XML file is written in English.
SVGs are basically text files, which makes them readable by humans.
This enables developers to make edits to XML files directly.
For instance, I could replace the fill value to change the color of the circle:   Of course, we can accomplish a lot more with vectors than just basic circles.
 Let’s look at a more complex image, the HubSpot sprocket logo:   Though a simple icon, this graphic consists of 30 lines connected by 30 points:   Let’s open this SVG file in a text editor:   Okay, there’s a bit more going on here, but the concept is the same.
We still have our <style> tag, which tells us the color.
Instead of a <circle> tag to give us the shape, we have a <path> tag.
All the values in this tag specify the points of the graphic and the lines between these points.
 How to Open an SVG File  The good news is that most browsers are designed to render, interpret, and display SVG files.
To open a .svg file, launch your browser, then open the file, and it will show in your browser.
 Let’s now look at how websites tend to apply SVGs.   What are SVG files used for?
 SVG files work best for images that contain less detail than a photograph.
That’s still rather broad, so let’s discuss some of the most common uses of SVGs online.
 Icons  Most icons translate well to vectors, given their simplicity and clearly defined borders.
Icons for page elements like buttons must be responsive for varying screen sizes, which means they must be perfectly scalable.
 Logos  The SVG format is particularly well suited for logos, which appear in website headers, emails, and print on anything from pamphlets to hoodies to billboards.
Again, logos tend to be simpler in design, which lends nicely to the SVG format.
 Illustrations  Vectors also suit non-photo visual art nicely.
Decorative webpage drawings can scale easily and conserve file space if added as SVG files.
You can create the illustrations below, even the textures on some shapes, with SVGs.  Here's an example:   Image Source  Animations and Interface Elements  By harnessing the capabilities of CSS and JavaScript, you can set SVGs to change their appearance dynamically and trigger automatically during or after an event.
Animated SVGs can serve to add visual flair to your pages, or you can use them to engage with user interface animations:   Image Source  Infographics and Data Visualizations  Would your website benefit from informational displays, like an infographic or illustrated chart ?
This is another useful application for SVGs. Your designs will scale seamlessly, and text within the SVG file is indexable.
Again, this is helpful for your SEO optimization efforts.

For instance, you could create a "progress bar" vector for a fundraiser that fills out as the donation total increases.
 You’ll also see SVGs implemented often on informational sites for data visualizations and maps.
Check out this example below.

   3.
unDraw  Best For: completely free SVG images   unDraw offers completely free SVG illustrations for various projects, which makes it a go-to resource for designers and developers looking for high-quality images without copyright concerns.
 It also lets you customize the color of the illustrations to match your visual aesthetics.
  Advantages of SVG Files  XML code isn’t just neat to look at — it makes SVG files powerful and practical for website and web applications, as we’ll explore in this section.
 1.
Infinite Scalability  It’s right there in the name: You can shrink or expand SVGs to any size without losing quality.
Image size and display type don’t matter with SVGs — they always look the same.
Because of this, SVG files are a fan-favorite if quality is important to you.
 This is important because the size of web images differs by viewer, based on browser window dimensions, device, zoom ratio, site layout, and responsive design.
Your images must appear fully rendered to every viewer, and SVGs make this a lot easier.
 Consider the HubSpot sprocket again.
Here’s the logo as an SVG, 100 pixels wide:   And here’s the same logo in PNG format, also 100 pixels wide:   They look pretty indistinguishable now, but the difference in quality is obvious when I scale each up to five times the size:   Can you see the difference now?
 If you want to expand or shrink an SVG file, the program reading the file readjusts the points and lines to retain clear boundaries and solid colors.
 Raster images, in contrast, appear pixelated when blown up on our screens.
While there are workarounds for this problem to keep the raster formula — like using different files of increasing size for the same image — they take more work and are more prone to errors.
Raster images were not designed for scaling.
 However, there’s a tradeoff to better scalability: By design, SVGs lack the detail of raster images.
You can only convey so much visual information from a vector system, but a raster format can display images as detailed as the bitmap allows.
Any attempt to perfectly represent a detailed PNG (such as a photograph) as a vector will result in a massive and impractical SVG file.
(But we’ll talk more about that later.)  So, both file types have their place in web design.
Use PNGs, JPEGs, and other raster formats for photos, and try SVGs for anything less detailed.
 2.
Customization  SVGs give designers and developers a lot of control over their appearance.
Rather than modifying the files directly in a text editor, you can use one of many SVG-compatible editing programs to change your vector shapes, colors, text, and even other visual effects like color gradients and shadow.
 3.
Scripting Compatibility  The SVG file format was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium as a standardized format for web graphics, designed to work with other web conventions like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the document object model.
 Thanks to this compatibility, you can control SVG images with scripts.
This opens the door for various dynamic display possibilities, from animations to dynamic charts to mobile-responsive images.
This level of control over appearance isn’t possible with JPEG and PNG formats.
 4.
Accessibility and Search Engine Optimization  SVG files are text files, offering some advantages over raster formats.
First, as we’ve covered, programmers can look at the XML code and quickly understand it.
 Also, if an SVG graphic contains text, the text information is stored in the file as literal text (not as shapes).
This allows screen readers to interpret SVGs, helping those with difficulties interacting with digital content.
 Lastly, search engines like Google can index SVG files.
Include keyword text in the image if you want to place a text-heavy infographic or other SVG display on your page.
This can help your page rank and improve your SEO.
PNGs and JPEGs are limited to metadata and alt text in this respect.
 5.
Smaller File Sizes  SVG files store images more efficiently than common raster formats if the image isn’t too detailed.
SVG files contain enough information to display vectors at any scale, whereas bitmaps require larger files for scaled-up versions of images — more pixels use more file space.
 This is good for websites because smaller files load faster on browsers.
Ultimately, using SVGs ensures your pages aren’t weighed down by images and don’t take forever to load.
 Disadvantages of SVG Files  While there are many great use cases for SVG images, this may not be the best format for every project.
There are two notable reasons why you may not choose to use an SVG file.
 1.
Not the right format for high-quality or detailed photos.
 Designers create vector graphics with points and paths, not pixels.
So, you can create a vector graphic by tracing a photograph or using a converter to change your photo into an SVG.
But your final image won't look exactly like your photograph.
  2.
Requires some knowledge of code.
  SVG is an XML-based scene description language for graphics.
Many web designers use HTML to adjust fonts, spacing, and more.
Like HTML , SVG is great for people with some engineering know-how.
But if you're not comfortable manipulating code, this may not be your favorite image format.
   How to Make or Edit an SVG File    Create a design to convert to a scalable vector graphic file.

Create a design to convert to a scalable vector graphic file.
 Develop a design in Illustrator that you want to convert to an SVG file.
Ensure smooth imagery with distinctly indicated corners or curves for a clean transition from non-SVG to SVG.
 2.
Trace your design.
 Click Image Trace over the design in the artboard for Illustrator to select.
In the drop-down menu, navigate to Advanced Options .
Every design is unique, so make sure to adjust as fit.
  It's a best practice to lower the number of paths to further smooth the borders of the design.
When done, select Outline View to clarify the design’s borders and the number of nodes present.
 3.
Convert your design into a vector image.
 Click Expand to take the design you’ve identified and make it into a vector.
For simple designs like this one, open the Magic Wand tool, click back onto the white of the artboard and delete it.
This will discard the background and leave the transparent layer with your vector visible.
 4.
Resize the artboard as needed.
 The smaller the file is, the better it will read on a website.
This makes it more likely to improve Google page performance ranking.
 5.
Fine-tune your design.
 Refine your design by removing unnecessary nodes with the Simply or Smooth tool.
Adjust as needed to simplify the paths without adverse effects.
 Designers will often create more than one design on a single artboard.
If this is typical for you, you'll want to separate your new design from any others you may have present on the artboard.
To do this, use the Magic Wand tool, then click the Group Selection tool.
 6.
Export your file as an SVG.
 Once you select your design, click File > Export > Export As SVG (*.SVG).
  7.
Copy and paste the XML code to use your design online.
 Click Show Code in SVG Options to view the XML, then copy to use as you create or optimize your website images.

To inject some life into your page content, you might want to try adding a background video with CSS.
  Video backgrounds take up the entire width and height of the viewport (in other words, the visible page area) and add some visual flair to boost engagement.
Over this video, you can place your featured page content — after all, it is just a background, and your content is most important.
  Video backgrounds may seem like a fancy feature, but they’re actually easy to implement if you know some CSS .
In this guide, we’ll show you how to add a simple fullscreen video background to your webpage, which you can tweak and adapt to your needs.
 How to Create a Fullscreen Video Background With CSS  To show you how to create video backgrounds for your site, we'll share some code that you can copy to modify for your needs.
We'll also see the code in action with some responsive video background CodePen modules.
 Let’s start with our HTML.
First, we’ll place a video on our page with the <video> tag and several attributes.
  <video id="background-video" autoplay loop muted poster="https://assets.codepen.io/6093409/river.jpg">
  <source src="https://assets.codepen.io/6093409/river.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>  All of these attributes are important for the background to work as intended, so let’s go through each one:   The id attribute is for styling our video element with CSS.
This is necessary to achieve the fullscreen background effect.
 The autoplay attribute starts the video automatically once the page loads.
 The loop attribute plays the video in an infinite loop.
 The muted attribute turns off sound for the video.
Generally, you shouldn't play video sound on your page unless the user turns on sound.
Doing so is an accessibility issue and can make for an unpleasant user experience.
 Finally, the poster image is shown on the screen as the video is loading, or in place of the video if it doesn’t load.
We recommend making your poster image the first frame of your video for the smoothest look.
  <video> tags usually include the controls attribute as well.
However, we’ve left it out because we don’t want users pausing the video or skipping around.

         After our video element, let’s add some HTML filler content to see how text appears against our video background.
  <h1>THIS IS A RIVER.</h1>
<h2>How majestic.</h2>  With the HTML done, let’s handle the CSS business.
To turn our normal video into a background video, add the following CSS:   #background-video {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  object-fit: cover;
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: -1;
}  Let’s go through each of these rules to understand what they do:   height: 100vw (viewport width) and width: 100vh (viewport height) make the video extend to the full width and height of the viewport.
 object-fit: cover automatically sizes the background video to keep its original aspect ratio while filling the screen, clipping out edges of the video when necessary.
 position: fixed and the following left , right , top , and bottom position the video relative to the viewport and separates it from the rest of the page content.
This keeps the video in place when the user scrolls, and allows other content to sit on top of it.
 z-index places the video background under accompanying content.
  Next, we’ll add some styling for our other page content.
For accessibility, make sure text placed over video provides ample color contrast with the background:   h1, h2 {
  color: white;
  font-family: Trebuchet MS;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-align: center;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 6rem;
  margin-top: 30vh;
}
h2 { 
  font-size: 3rem; 
}  At this point, the video background will display nicely.
But, we haven’t accounted for mobile devices yet.
It’s usually a good idea to prevent auto-playing videos on mobile, since the data needed to play them is significant and users didn’t request to play the video in the first place.
 Instead, we’ll add a media query that substitutes the video with our poster image on screens 750 pixels wide or smaller.
  @media (max-width: 750px) {
  #background-video { display: none; }
  body {
    background: url("https://assets.codepen.io/6093409/river.jpg") no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
  }
}  When we combine everything, we get a sleek video background that scales with the screen and displays an image on mobile devices.
(Note: Click here to see the example with the video playing .)  See the Pen Video Background 1 by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  If you need more help learning how to make this code work for your site, check out this CSS background YouTube video tutorial:       Add More Page Content  We’ve already put some headings on the page to see how content looks against a video background.
 Still, your page will probably contain more content than a video background and some title text.
So, let’s add a <main> section to our example that appears when the user scrolls down.
This element will cover the video to bring the focus to your main content.
(Note: Click here to see the example with the video playing .)  See the Pen Video Background 2 by Christina Perricone ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  We’ve given our <main> element a background color to cover up the video, as well as a top margin in viewport height units.
This way, the main content will appear as soon as the user starts scrolling.
 A CSS Video Background to Engage Your Audience  Life is short, and nobody wants to waste their time on a run-of-the-mill webpage.
With just a few lines of CSS, we’ve created a full-page video background template that you can customize for your audience.
 Using a site's background for a video might not be the ideal choice for every website, and are usually a no-go on mobile websites due to their impact on mobile performance.
However, if done well, video backgrounds can make quite an impact, and there’s no need to even push play.

[+ How to Embed Content With Iframes]    Download Now: Free HTML & CSS Coding Templates        Jamie Juviler     Updated: June 17, 2022   Published: April 20, 2021       Embedded content is common on websites.
Part of what makes the web so powerful is our ability to pull content from multiple servers to build a coherent website experience.
 Take videos, for instance.
How often do you see embedded YouTube videos on websites you visit?
I’d guess pretty frequently.
And if not, here you go:     Embedded videos can add a lot of value to your pages.
They help engage, inform, and delight your visitors, as long as they appear seamless with your other content.
Also, YouTube is a video hosting solution .
You don’t need to store these large files on your own servers — simply upload them to your business YouTube channel.
 If you want to embed YouTube videos — or any type of embeddable content — in your own website's HTML , one option is to utilize the iframe element.
  No, iframe is not an Apple product for holding your pictures.
It’s an important page element that allows for much of the cross-site compatibility we see online today.
Here’s what you need to know:    What is an iframe?
  An iframe, short for inline frame, is an HTML element that contains another HTML document within it.
The iframe element is specified with the iframe tag.
It may be placed anywhere in an HTML document, and thus anywhere on a web page.
Iframes are most often used to embed specific content from one web page — like a video, form, document, or even a full web page — within a different web page.
    This is a powerful capability in HTML — you can take any content from any website (with permission) and place it on your own site to enhance your content.
 How to Make an Iframe  To use an iframe, we use the <iframe> HTML tag.
This tag requires a src (source) attribute, which specifies the URL of the HTML file to be embedded on the parent page.
In its most basic form, an iframe looks like this in HTML:   <iframe src="URL"></iframe>  A simple piece of functional iframe HTML code looks like this:   <iframe src="https://www.example.com/" width="1500px" height="500px"></iframe>  This code will embed a web page onto its parent page:     This embedded page exists separately from the parent page in terms of its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
You can view that example page here .
 You’ll also notice that this code snippet contains some extra attributes, width and height .
These set the dimensions of the iframe region that displays the embedded file.
width and height may be set as pixel values, or as percentages of the window, which scales the iframe proportionally to the size of the viewing window.
 Like other HTML elements, iframes can be customized with other attributes.
Here’s an overview of common iframe attributes:     attribute  purpose    allow  indicates what features the iframe is allowed to use (e.g. fullscreen , camera , autoplay )    allowfullscreen  grants or denies permission for the iframe to appear in full-screen mode    height  sets the height of the iframe (if not specified, the default height is 150 pixels)    loading  sets lazy loading or eager loading for the iframe    referrerpolicy  sets what referrer information should be sent in the request for the iframe    src  the address of the resource included in the iframe    width  sets the width of the iframe (if not specified, the default width is 300 pixels)     Iframe vs.
Embed  Before we continue, you might have heard of another similar HTML5 element called embed .
Like iframe , the embed element is used to embed an external resource in a web page.
However, these two elements do slightly different things.
 As mentioned, we use iframe to embed an HTML document onto a page.
Alternatively, embed is used to embed other types of content, including PDFs, browser plugins, and Flash animations.
The embed element can also be used to place media, but iframe is better for this purpose.
 Because embed is really only useful for embedding outdated web technologies, you likely won’t need it — iframe is much more common and will almost always do the job.
Next, let’s see what this element is capable of.
 How are iframes Used?
 Websites often use iframes to embed media from external websites.
For example, here’s the embed code for a HubSpot YouTube video embedded at the top of this post:   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S93nYy-Bxzo" 
frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; 
gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Embedded maps are another common use of iframes.
Google Maps allows you to copy embed code from any map location and display it on your website:       The map above is the result of this iframe code:   <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1718.6454008049905!2d-71.07787073663287!3d42.36955552931532!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89e370bc261e50e5%3A0xf3cba8437d505a26!2sHubSpot!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1602001548652!5m2!1sen!2sus" 
width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" 
aria-hidden="false" tabindex="0"></iframe>  Also, display advertisements are often created with iframes.
While images and gifs are static elements, a fully embedded HTML document allows for scripting.
With this method, ads can be made interactive, as well as track impressions and clicks.
 How to Make an Iframe Responsive  So far, we’ve seen how to implement iframes on desktop websites.
But what about mobile pages?
With more users viewing websites and videos through smartphones and tablets, it’s important to understand how iframes can adapt to smaller screens.
 Luckily, making mobile-friendly iframes requires just a bit of CSS knowledge to pull off.
Let’s take our YouTube video example again:   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S93nYy-Bxzo"></iframe>  For your own implementation, replace the YouTube URL within the quotes with your own YouTube embed URL.
 Next, we’ll remove the width and height attributes from the HTML.
When these are set, the iframe will always match these dimensions, regardless of device.
We don’t want that.
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S93nYy-Bxzo"></iframe>  Now, we’ll enclose our iframe in a container div .
This container will resize based on screen width:   <div class=”container>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S93nYy-Bxzo"></iframe>
</div>  Lastly, apply the following CSS to the above HTML:   .container {
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
}
.container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border: 0;
}  Let’s quickly unpack this styling:  The .container section applies to the <div> that holds the iframe.
The padding-top property value of 56.25% is important for embedding YouTube videos specifically — it ensures the entire video is visible, no matter the width of the container.
This value is calculated from the standard YouTube aspect ratio of 16:9 (i.e., 9 / 16 = .5625).
For videos with different aspect ratios, the value of padding-top should be calculated the same way.
 The .container iframe styling applies to the iframe itself.
It sets the iframe to take up the entire space of its parent container.
 When this CSS is applied, you’ll see the video conforms to the screen width:   Using Iframes: Some Words of Caution  Iframes can be very useful, but you should be aware of their drawbacks.
 First, make absolutely sure that the site or content you embed is trustworthy and secure.
If attackers successfully inject harmful code into a web page that you embed, it could harm your website too.
 Second, iframes can affect page performance if the embedded content takes too long to retrieve from its host.
Avoid placing too many iframes on a single page (unless you’re writing an informative blog post about them), and consider taking advantage of the loading attribute:   <iframe src="URL" loading="lazy"></iframe>  “lazy” sets the iframe to load only after it enters the visitor’s view, which works to decrease the time of initial page load.
 Finally, consider the effect of iframes on your pages’ SEO.
Google recommends avoiding iframes and other rich media content on your website, as this content is harder to index than plain HTML content.
If you still want to use an iframe, provide text-based links to any content linked in your iframe if you can so search engine crawlers can recognize them.
 Iframe is one of the oldest HTML elements, and its resilience and usefulness tell us it’s here to stay for a while.
For embedding content, this element is a must for your HTML tool belt.

  Written by:  Madison Zoey Vettorino      WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY CHECKLIST  A checklist to help you make your website more accessible and usable – available as a PDF or on Google Sheets.
 Get the Checklist          Updated: 04/16/24   Published: 03/05/24        By prioritizing web accessibility, you can ensure all of your visitors — regardless of ability — have a seamless experience on your website.
Unfortunately, many sites don’t comply with web accessibility best practices and guidelines.
For users with disabilities, a site that doesn't comply is difficult or downright impossible to use.
   The good news is that there’s a fix, and that's where enacting accessibility best practices comes into the picture.
The solution to this issue is to make your website inclusive for everyone.
That includes the format, structure, navigation, visuals, and written content.
 I’ve come across websites that only prioritize accessibility for folks with blindness or deafness, and these still isolate a large chunk of the population with a disability.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 16% of the global population has a disability, so your site must serve as many people as possible.
 However, with so many folks having various disabilities, it's understandable if you're overwhelmed with where to begin, or aren't sure what adhering to accessibility best practices looks like on your site.
Luckily, I am here to help.
 I’ll walk you through everything you need to know to develop a site that complies with best practices for accessibility in web design.
    Chapters        prev       next         What Is Web Accessibility?
          Web Accessibility Standards           How to Make Your Website Accessible           Web Accessibility Tools           Web Accessibility Examples           Tips for Creating Equitable Web Experiences                       What is web accessibility?
  Web accessibility is the practice of creating websites that are usable for all visitors regardless of a disability or impairment.
To fulfill web accessibility best practices, you must create a site that complies with certain design and development guidelines that ensure your site is set up to accommodate folks with disabilities.
This ensures that all users have the same or similar experience regardless of ability.
     When asked what web accessibility means to him, Matt Fehskens, Senior Software Engineer II at HubSpot , says, “Web accessibility for me is the ability for everyone to be able to use websites in an unobtrusive and efficient way.
This means not requiring people to navigate obstacles just to get to the content they need as well as delivering functionality that doesn’t exclude.”  To me, that’s the key distinction between an inclusive site and one that excludes: Whether or not folks can use the site in an unobtrusive, intuitive way.
(I highly recommend you consider this when creating an accessible website.)  Kieran Forde, Senior Content Designer II, at HubSpot, reiterates this.
“Web accessibility is about making sure that everyone can have great online experiences, regardless of the technology or assistance they use,” Forde says.
 Pro Tip: Before you launch your website's accessibility updates, run a focus group with users who have various disabilities to get real-time feedback on how you can improve.
 Who manages web accessibility on the internet?
 So, who's in charge of the web accessibility initiative and works to enforce it across the internet?
The answer is the members of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WIP) of The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) .
These organizations are responsible for publishing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) (which we'll review below) and related content.

        Why is web accessibility important?
 One in six people have a disability, according to the WHO.
By making accessibility in web design an afterthought, your site effectively eliminates a large chunk of the population from using or enjoying it.
And by embracing web accessibility best practices, you're able to offer a more inclusive experience for all.
“When I think about accessibility, I try to think about making something that is usable for the greatest possible number of people,” shares Anna Gallo, a Web Developer at HubSpot .
“Everyone deserves equal access to the web, and striving for inclusion is the right thing to do.”  Ultimately, your goal in prioritizing website accessibility is that more users can access your site.
Charlotte Cameron, Senior Web Developer at HubSpot , summarizes it well.
“Designing and developing for web accessibility means more people have equal access to the web,” Cameron says.
 I also encourage you to remember that there are plenty of different types of disabilities and limitations to ensure your site caters to as many folks as possible.
Some of these include:    Blindness    Low vision    Learning disabilities    Cognitive disabilities    Deafness    Hearing loss    Speech disabilities    Physical disabilities    Web accessibility isn’t optional — it’s a must-have, and shouldn’t be an afterthought.
There’s another crucial reason why prioritizing site accessibility is essential: Because it demonstrates your company’s commitment to inclusivity.
By making web accessibility a core pillar of your site, you show your visitors that you care about their experience as individuals.
 This investment will boost your brand loyalty and advocacy, but that isn’t why I advise you to do it.
Web accessibility is critical because it’s the right thing to do.
In fact, I’d argue it’s downright irresponsible to have a website that doesn’t cater to folks with disabilities and limitations.
Not to mention, there can be serious repercussions for your company fiscally.
 “The repercussions which I think grab the attention of businesses the most are the fiscal ones,” shares Fehskens.
“However, more costly than fines can be the loss of users or, even worse, an experience so bad you create an evangelist against your product—this would be someone who has such a distaste that they actively discourage others from using your product.”  Gallo echoes this.
“If you are designing and developing your website without accessibility in mind, you are missing out on a huge number of leads and conversions,” she says.
“Because user experience and engagement impact SEO, it's also good for your rankings to make sure your site is accessible.”   Ultimately, it’s a combination of all of these reasons that makes web accessibility critical.
“Fundamentally, [web accessibility] means equitable access to the web, and everything on it - information, products, services, and opportunities,” says Cameron.
“By removing barriers that restrict groups of users from the web, we can promote diversity and facilitate belonging.
This benefits business, society, and everyone in it.”  Meeting certain standards for accessibility in web design may sound like the right thing to do at this point (and it is) — but is it required of you by law ?

 Access now     Learn more           How is web accessibility enforced?
 Good question! Ultimately, unless you run a government website, there aren’t enforceable laws related to web accessibility — yet.
(But if you do run a government site, you have to abide by  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act guidelines.)  Even though prioritizing web accessibility isn’t technically required by law, it doesn’t mean your business can’t face legal or financial repercussions for being inaccessible.
Let's review some examples of large companies getting sued for lacking an accessible website.
 In 2023 alone, there were over 4600 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-related lawsuits, according to UsableNet .
For example, in the Gil v.
Winn-Dixie decision , a court ruled that websites may constitute “public accommodations” under the ADA .
 If your business has physical stores, its site can be considered heavily integrated with the brick-and-mortar location.
So, your website is considered a “gateway” to the physical store.
Because of this, websites constitute “a service of public accommodation,” which is covered by the ADA.
 In other words, websites are expected to meet certain accessibility standards.
(Psst: Even if your business doesn’t have a brick-and-mortar store, you should still ensure your site meets web accessibility standards.
It's the right thing to do.)  Here’s another example of how your business can face legal repercussions.
In Domino’s Pizza v.
Guillermo Robles , a court ruled in favor of Robles, a blind man who could not order food through Domino’s website and app despite using screen-reading software.
 In this case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said, "...
alleged inaccessibility of Domino’s website and app impedes access to the goods and services of its physical pizza franchises —which are places of public accommodation."  All that’s to say, to avoid legal trouble — or to avoid pushing visitors with disabilities away — it’s imperative to ensure your site doesn’t prevent anyone from consuming, navigating, or obtaining any of the information you share.
 So, how do you do this?
I’m glad you asked.
The best way is by abiding by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium .
I’ll walk you through those standards you’ll need to uphold now.
 Pro Tip: Web accessibility best practices change frequently, so avoid thinking of creating an accessible site as a one-off event.
You'll need to continuously fine-tune it.
  Web Accessibility Standards  The WCAG states that there are four main principles you’ll need to follow to create an accessible website: That your site is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
Within these principles, you can dive deeper into guidelines to reference and apply to your site.
 1.
Perceivable  First, it’s imperative that visitors can perceive or understand and be aware of the content you present on your website.
 Keep in mind that “perceive” doesn’t always equate to seeing with one’s eyes — users who have blindness or low vision often use screen reader software , which converts text into synthesized speech or braille characters.
Your job is to consider all the ways you can make your content as perceivable as possible when creating and updating your site.
 2.
Operable  Next up is operable.
An operable website means your visitors can use it without disruption.
It also means that all visitors can use each part of the site’s functionality, from navigating to the contact page to selecting a link from a menu to playing a video.
 Generally speaking, you can make your site more operable by keeping it simple.
Additionally, you may consider ditching excess functionality that could impede users with disabilities and limitations.
 3.
Understandable  In addition, your site content must be understandable.
Yes, this refers to both your written and graphic content.
 Keep in mind that folks with various cognitive disabilities are visiting your site.
You're isolating valuable users if your site is too verbose or jumbled.
This also spells trouble for folks who don’t speak your site’s predominant language.
Keep it digestible.
 This also applies to your site structure.
Your pages must be intuitively organized, and your navigation readily available.
 4.
Robust  Lastly, your content should be robust enough to be easily interpreted by folks with various assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
To achieve this, write HTML that allows assistive technologies to parse your code without a visual reference.
 Pro Tip: It's not enough if your site is operable but not robust.
Aim to check the box on all four of these principles.
  How to Make Your Website Accessible  After reviewing the principles above, you may realize that your current site isn’t quite up to par with web accessibility standards.
Or maybe you used an accessibility testing tool to diagnose any issues and didn’t receive the best score.
Either way, don’t panic — the WCAG offers specific guidelines for each principle we walked through.
Let’s unpack how you can implement these best practices to create a site that checks all the boxes for web accessibility.
 Or, for an even more comprehensive review of these guidelines, see our complete web accessibility checklist .

 Access now     Learn more           Perceivable Web Accessibility Guidelines  Ready to make sure your site is perceivable?
Here's what you need to know.
 Offer text alternatives.
 All non-text items on your page, such as images, videos, and audio, must have a text alternative.
This allows folks with blindness or low vision to understand the content.
Image alt text is a must-have to add context for all users, so you should add it to all non-decorative images on your site.
For decorative images, include the alt attribute but leave it blank, i.e.:    <img src="decorative.png" alt="" />   This indicates to the screen reader that an image exists, but it can ignore it.
I’d also encourage you to add alt text for other elements of your site that can be difficult for assistive technologies to interpret, such as graphs or tables.
 Offer alternative ways to consume time-based media.
 Time-based media comprises audio and video content.
For video content, ensure captions are in sync.
This assists users with hearing limitations.
For audio, ensure you offer a full transcript of the recording.
 For instance, check out this video on HubSpot's YouTube channel .
Notice how there's a caption that's synced up with the video, as well as a description text detailing what's occurring in the video for folks with auditory limitations?
  Structure content in an adaptable way.
 This guideline helps ensure your HTML files are written in a way that wouldn’t lose intended information and structure if page styling was removed.
For example, proper headings , ordered and unordered list elements, and bold and italic text convey information.
 Make your content easy to see and hear.
 Utilize color contrast so everyone, including individuals with color blindness, can easily read your content.
Additionally, users should be able to adjust any background audio on your site or halt audio playback altogether.
This is important for visitors with a range of disabilities.
 Some websites, such as HubSpot's, feature a toggle option so visitors can choose their color contrast.
This gives visitors complete control over the experience they have on the website.
  Operable Web Accessibility Guidelines  Next up is operable.
Here's how you can apply this accessibility guideline to your site.
 Ensure complete functionality via the keyboard.
 Ensure users can navigate your site without a mouse or touchpad, but instead, use the keyboard.
For example, the tab key should let users jump between selectable elements on the page, and the enter/return key should "click" the element in focus.
 Provide ample time to engage with your website.
 Allow users to read, watch, and engage with the content on your site within a reasonable time constraint.
If an action on your site includes a time limitation, ensure users can extend or cancel it.
The guideline also applies to accessible drop-down menus : If a user disengages with the menu from the mouse, setting a time delay before the menu disappears is necessary.
 For instance, on the HubSpot website, the drop down menu doesn't disappear right away.
You can check out out yourself.
 Avoid blinking/flashing content.
 According to W3C, content that blinks or flashes more than three times in a second can trigger seizures.
It’s smart to avoid this.
But if you can’t for any reason, it’s imperative to provide visitors with a clear warning.
 Provide navigation to help users know where they are and where they can go.
 A clear page title, meaningful links, a keyboard focus indicator, and proper headings signal to users where they are on your site.
Because of this, they are an absolute must.
 Understandable Web Accessibility Guidelines  Our next principle to review is understandable.
Here's how you can ensure your site is understandable for all folks that encounter it.
 Make text content readable.
 Think about the full scope of your audience when building your content.
Your writing needs to be clear and concise both for folks with cognitive disabilities and those who aren’t native speakers of your site’s primary language.
Avoid regional slang and highly technical jargon.
 Structure your pages logically.
 When planning your site's structure and navigation, intuitively place your navigational links and pages.
This means keeping navigation above the fold, most commonly in the page's header (and footer).
 Write useful error messages.
 Error messages are frustrating, so provide a clear description of the error and instructions to help visitors correct a mistake.
For instance, here’s what HubSpot’s error message looks like.
  Robust Web Accessibility Guidelines  Last but not least is robust.
Here's what you need to know about making sure your site is robust.
 Write HTML that can be parsed.
 Assistive technologies utilize a web page's HTML file to translate its contents into a different format.
Because of this, your pages' HTML code must be well-written.
Use start and end tags when required, and avoid duplicate IDs across elements and duplicate attributes within the same HTML tag.
 You’re doing a great job keeping up with everything related to web accessibility! Now, let’s look at some tools you can use to help make your site more accessible.
  Web Accessibility Tools  The good news is that there are countless web accessibility testing tools available to help you determine how you can get your site up to speed.
W3C has compiled and shared a list of them on their website so you can peruse some top choices.
We also have a list of our favorite tool recommendations .

I recommend these accessible websites you can reference when designing or recreating yours.
 1.
W3C  Unsurprisingly, W3C has everything an accessible website should, including well-structured HTML with clear tags to denote structure, color contrast, simple language, and a focus indicator for the currently selected page element.
Peruse this site for an example of what excellence in website accessibility looks like.
  Image Source  2.
The Cram Foundation  The Cram Foundation focuses on supporting those with disabilities, so of course, it has a WCAG-compliant website.
The site balances web accessibility with an aesthetically pleasing and branded design.
The bright site meets all WCAG color and contrast standards, and its navigation is accessible in both structure and color, which stands out to me.
  Image Source  3.
US Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention  The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention is a government website that must be accessible.
It does meet this goal, thanks to a myriad of accessible features it includes.
The site includes a page that outlines how the Center works to meet and exceed the accessibility standards set forth in Section 508.
Additionally, the page describes how visitors with comments about their web accessibility can get in touch.
 The site's standard navigation is digestible, which stands out to me.
It also offers visitors a couple of different navigation options so they can maneuver around the site in the way that best suits their needs.
 Several different content types are available on the site, too, so visitors can get the information they need in a format that works for them (e.g., written, audio, video).
This is crucial for a government site with a wide audience.
  Image Source  4.
Healthmonix  Healthmonix leverages cloud-based technology payment solutions for health systems and medical groups.
Its website demonstrates an impressive adherence to accessibility standards.
The navigational layout is intuitive, the content is structured in a clear hierarchy, and color contrast ensures readable text.
  Image Source  5.
Unilever  Unilever owns 400 brands and sells consumer goods to over 2 billion people globally.
For this reason, it has committed to ensuring its website is accessible to all visitors — and it shares information about this investment on a dedicated site page .
(Psst: Creating a statement outlining your commitment to accessibility is a great idea!)  The website's accessible features include accommodation for assistive technologies and code (e.g., screen readers, software for text-to-speech or speech-to-speech, keyboard emulator, screen magnifier, enhanced UI, and visual styling).
 Unilever's website also meets or exceeds the WCAG regarding color and contrast, layout and navigation, browser support, text alternatives, audio and video content, and more.
  Image Source  6.
The Financial Gym  The Financial Gym is a personal finance coaching service with an accessible website.
It utilizes text and image colors to offer ample contrast while maintaining adherence to the company's branding.
Layout and navigation are intuitive enough to navigate with a screen reader and a keyboard.
Also, videos on the homepage do not auto-play, so users have full control over the media playback.
  Image Source  7.
The White House  Like some other websites mentioned, the White House is a government site, so it must offer an accessible experience for all users.
When you arrive on the homepage, visitors are greeted with a section where they can toggle high contrast and alter the text size.
 I love how front and center this is, as users don’t have to search the site to make accessibility adjustments.
As you can see, there is alt text, too.
Then, at the bottom of the page, you can learn more about accessibility by checking the accessibility statement page.

 You’ve read this post — that’s a great starting point for your journey with web accessibility! Your next step is to dive deeper into the world of WCAG.
“It’s important to familiarize yourself with laws and standards related to disability and accessibility,” says Gallo.
 “These vary depending on where you live, but the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a set of standards that can help website owners achieve compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508, and other laws.
Reading more about WCAG standards is a great starting point.”  By using your resources, you can ensure that you’re covering all your bases when it comes to web accessibility.
“There are some great practical tips on the w3 Writing for Web Accessibility page ,” says Forde.
 Pro Tip: Peruse examples of other accessible sites to get inspired as you create yours.
 Remember: Website accessibility isn’t an afterthought.
 The earlier you prioritize website accessibility, the better off you’ll be.
“Prioritize accessibility as early as possible,” recommends Cameron.
“This is called ‘shifting left;’ the idea is to keep accessibility in mind as early into your product lifecycle as possible.
This tends to lead to a better user experience for all users.
It also hugely reduces the effort required to make a site accessible compared to trying to identify and fix issues after the fact.”  Taking a proactive rather than reactive approach allows you to immerse your users in a completely accessible site.
Moreover, your users will likely be able to tell if accessibility was an afterthought for your company when building the site.
“It’s easier to build something in an accessible way than it is to go back and fix accessibility issues after the fact, so considering accessibility as early in your project as possible is always a good idea,” says Gallo.
 Pro Tip: When working on your website build or redesign, assign one person the role of begin an accessibility advocate.
Throughout the project, ask them to flag potential issues and advocate for accessibility.
 Design for everyone.
 I can’t reiterate this enough: It’s important to consider the range of disabilities folks have when creating your site.
“Some people with disabilities rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation, and there are special considerations we must make when designing and developing a website to ensure assistive technologies work correctly on that site,” says Gallo.
 “However, making sure your website works with assistive technologies is just a starting point in creating an equitable experience.
There are also best practices to make things more usable for neurodivergent people, people with dyslexia and dyscalculia, and people with anxiety, among many other considerations.”  By considering as many different disabilities as possible, you can build a truly equitable web experience for all.
“The first persona that comes to mind when most people think of web accessibility is users with blindness, but there are many others,” says Fehskens.
 “My favorite example of users that I believe are routinely overlooked are those with arthritis.
Imagine having rheumatoid arthritis in your hand, which makes it difficult or impossible to use a mouse, but the only way to use a website is through a drag-and-drop interface.
This user is incapable of using your website’s functionality because of that drag-and-drop.”  Pro Tip: Use an accessibility checklist to walk through the different disabilities you should design for.
 Test your website.
 Sure, testing can help you diagnose problems off the bat.
Still, if you rely on automated testing, you’re missing out on a wealth of information that can help you better construct a truly equitable web experience.
“Don’t rely on automated testing - manual testing is just as important,” says Cameron.
 “There are a number of excellent tools which you can use to audit your website’s accessibility (like axe DevTools - not sponsored!), but these tools aren’t a replacement for manual usability testing.
The best thing to do is to get hands-on - try navigating your website with a keyboard or with screen reader software.
You’ll likely run into friction points you didn’t realize were there.”  Pro Tip: Test your website on multiple tools to gain different insights.
 Try it yourself before rolling out the website.
 Before you introduce your website to the world, it’s wise to try it yourself to determine if there are any obstacles you’ve overlooked in the design and development process.
“I especially think it's important for everyone involved in producing a web product (designers, engineers, program managers, etc.) to use their website without a mouse,” says Fehskens.
 “Just use your keyboard and try to tab through to your content.
It quickly becomes apparent the hurdles anyone who cannot use a mouse must traverse as their basic experience with the web.”  Pro Tip: Don't forget to try your mobile app, too!  Remember that web accessibility is a journey.
 The first time you publish your website certainly won’t be the last time you update it, right?
Web accessibility is like that, too.
It’s important to continuously update your site to reflect new, up-and-coming best practices or standards.
 “Try to view building an accessible site as an ongoing process, not a one-off event,” suggests Cameron.
“As your website grows and evolves, continuing to place emphasis on ensuring your site is inclusive and accessible will help to ensure everyone has equitable access to your content.”  Pro Tip: If you need help creating an accessible site, consider working with an accessibility consultant.
 Designing Websites for Everyone  By making your site accessible, you can rest assured your site will appeal to as many folks as possible — not to mention, avoid potential legal ramifications.
“I think it’s so important to note that developing with accessibility is a rising tide which lifts all boats,” shares Fehskens.
“Providing accessibility for all users will only improve the overall experience for all users, and when you do that, you provide a product/service that keeps your users coming back time and time again.”  By enriching your website with accessibility best practices, you’re helping all your users.
“Creating accessible experiences almost always benefits a much wider group of people than just people with life-long conditions,” says Forde.
 “Using high color contrast and large text in a design benefits people with sight conditions, as well as people working on screens with sun glare.
Adding captions to a video helps people with hearing conditions, as well as people who forgot their headphones, or people trying to watch something on mute whilst they rock a baby to sleep.
Writing clearly and simply benefits people with cognitive conditions, as well as people learning a new language.”  Now that you know why web accessibility is essential, you can prioritize it in your site design.
This will create a memorable and positive UX and help you boost customer loyalty.

       11 of the Best Microsite Examples We've Ever Seen    Visit HubSpot's Website Theme Marketplace        Jamie Juviler     Published: April 28, 2022       They say the best things often come in small packages.
Think about it: jewelry, books, the keys to a new car ...
all of these things support this notion.
And with our attention spans shrinking below that of a goldfish , it should come as no surprise that we crave more focused content at a smaller scale, too.
  Here’s where microsites come into play.
Unlike regular websites, microsites tend to be simplistic and easier to navigate.
This isn't to say they won't make you want to poke around for a while, though.
In fact, the really great ones do just that.
In this post, we’ll show you some great design examples of microsites in action.
  What is a microsite?
 A microsite is a web page or small website made to promote a company’s product, service, campaign, or event.
Microsites typically use a different domain or subdomain from the main company website and include links back to the main website, but act as a separate entity for the brand.
 Microsites can help brands achieve a number of things.
As HubSpot Product Manager Alex Girard puts it, “You can use a website to create a digital experience for a number of different moments in the buyer’s journey.
It doesn’t have to be just a corporate ‘.com’ website for converting visitors to leads.
You can build digital experiences that span the entire customer journey.”  For example, many companies use them to highlight a specific campaign or target specific buyer personas.
Others use them to tell a short story or to experiment with new types of branded content, or to spread to a new region.
With a big event coming up, a company might launch a microsite to spread awareness and promote sign-ups.
 Whatever the reason, the goal of a microsite is to engage visitors with a specific message, generate interest, and draw them to the business’s offerings.
   Best Microsite Examples    Website Grader (HubSpot)  Listening Together (Spotify)  My Creative Type (Adobe)  Emojitracker (Emojipedia)  Elf Yourself (OfficeMax)  Blue Heart (Patagonia)  Inside CHANEL (Chanel)  Xbox Museum (Microsoft)  Life at Home (Ikea)  NASA Spacecraft (NASA)  Chipotle Farmers Market (Chipotle)      1.
Website Grader (HubSpot)  HubSpot Website Grader is a microsite to improve your website, for free.
Paste in your site’s URL and your email address, and Website Grader will leverage Google Lighthouse’s automated assessment system to assign a grade to your website.
  Website Grader calculates your grade based on four key factors — performance (how fast your website is), SEO, mobile, and security — each of which receives its own score.
For each factor, Website Grader breaks down your site’s rating and suggests areas for improvement.
  Along with its suggestions, Website Grader directs visitors to a HubSpot Academy course on increasing their website grade.
If users need more guidance, they can click one of several CTAs on the assessment page to take the course.
 2.
Listening Together (Spotify)  Spotify knows how to make a microsite — its hugely popular Spotify Wrapped series began as a microsite and has since become a feature of its mobile app.
In 2020, the streaming platform introduced a new microsite to support its Listening Together campaign.
  The microsite features a spinning three-dimensional map of the Earth covered with pins.
Each pair of pins represents two users pressing play on the same track at the same moment.
When you click a pin, you can hear the song being played, making this microsite a means for discovering new music.
  Overall, it’s the kind of microsite that only a brand like Spotify could pull off, a clever and heartwarming reminder of how music brings us together.
 3.
My Creative Type (Adobe)  Adobe’s software suite contains more than a couple of industry-standard tools for visual creatives.
Beyond the well-renowned tools it makes, a big force behind Adobe’s success is the brand’s ability to align itself with customers through marketing.
The microsite My Creative Type is a prime example.
  On this microsite, visitors complete a short questionnaire to determine their “creative personality.” The 15 questions assess your thinking, behavior, and outlook, each followed by a playful video metaphor for the answer you give.
  At the end, you’re given one of eight creative types (I got “the Maker”) and a description of your strengths, potential, motivations, and advice for pursuing creative goals.
You can then download your type or share it on social media.
  Though it’s not made entirely clear how empirically sound all of this is, it’s still a fun way to bring new aspiring artists into the fold.
 4.
Emojitracker (Emojipedia)  There’s no "point" to emojitracker.com.
It was created by Matthew Rothenberg, former Head of Product at Flickr and Bitly, as an experiment to track all emojis used on Twitter in real-time.
Now, it’s maintained as a microsite for Emojipedia .
  The only calls-to-action on the site are some outgoing links at the very bottom.
Otherwise, it's just for pure interest.
With no navigation bar or way to get to another site, it might actually confuse some visitors.
 Emojipedia might break some rules of user interface design, but it also shows that microsites don't need to have complicated designs and that a cool idea can get you pretty far.
Make it simple enough to keep people on the page without taking up too much of their time.
 5.
Elf Yourself (OfficeMax)  I think it’s a rule that you can’t write about microsites without mentioning Elf Yourself, perhaps the most successful microsite of all time.
Come the holiday season, expect your inbox to be rife with animations because Elf Yourself isn't going away.
  What made the site so popular in the first place?
Well, it’s hilarious.
Besides that, the content is easily shareable, the website is simple to use, and it makes the users the stars.
You would hardly know this is a corporate-sponsored site .
 OfficeMax used the microsite to be creative and let their freak flag fly, and actually pulled it off.
The company focused its campaign on the consumers, not the brand — but the sales tie-in came at the end of the Elf Yourself videos in the form of coupons and promos.
 6.
Blue Heart (Patagonia)  Patagonia is one of the few exceptional brands that not only offers a top-tier customer experience, but goes above and beyond in its advocacy work.
In a partnership with Farm League , the company created a microsite to draw attention to environmental harm caused by hydroelectric dams in the Balkan region.
  Unlike most other microsites, the Blue Heart website does not include prominent CTAs directing visitors to the main Patagonia website.
Instead, it places focus completely on the story being told with various elements: a short film, articles, and an interactive map.
  It’s rare for brands to put out microsites of this quality — Blue Heart is an engaging, visually rich experience with a mission that goes far beyond generating leads for the business to serve a greater mission.
 7.
Inside CHANEL (Chanel)  Inside Chanel is a microsite that harnesses multimedia to educate visitors on the company’s history and heritage.
The site houses a ton of short, social videos that chronicle the people, places, items, and events that have contributed to the continued success of this iconic fashion brand.
  The purpose?
“The strategy behind this microsite is to create some accessibility of Chanel’s history, but more importantly, their success throughout the years,” explains Dalia Strum, president of Dalia Inc.
 We love their video-centric approach to visual storytelling.
Each video pulls back the curtain and gives you an exclusive look at behind-the-scenes photos and stories as they pertain to different aspects of the brand — color, couture, and so on.
  This site isn't Chanel's first stab at microsite creation.
In fact, the brand has experimented with multiple microsite formats, including the editorial-style site Chanel News .
 8.
Xbox Museum (Microsoft)  To celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Xbox brand, Microsoft launched the microsite Xbox Museum, a virtual tour of its various consoles throughout the years.
  This content-rich site is built around the significant events in Xbox’s history, including console launches, design plans, game releases, and more.
You play as a character who navigates a virtual timeline, visiting articles marking each event.
  It’s a unique and fitting way to celebrate such a huge milestone for the business, plus a way to capture the nostalgia of long-time fans and the interest of new ones.
 9.
Life at Home (Ikea)  2020 and 2021 marked a major shift in where and how we spend our time.
To shed light on the intersection of mental health and living space, Ikea published a microsite of original research and ways to be happier at home.
  Throughout the report, readers learn how our mental health, families, and communities have changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
They emphasize the role of a comfortable living space and strong relationships in our mental well-being.
Other cool elements include a map visualization, videos, and short questions posed to the reader.
  Ikea’s microsite expertly connects the importance of safe living spaces and healthy relationships back to its branding, forming positive associations in the minds of visitors and bringing them closer to a purchase.
 10.
NASA Spacecraft (NASA)  Let’s be honest, spaceships are probably the coolest thing ever, and NASA knows this.
That’s why they launched (pun intended) this microsite: to catalog all of its satellites, from its first in 1960 all the way until its most recent launch, the James Webb Space Telescope.
  Each spacecraft has its own three-dimensional visualization that you can rotate and view from various angles, along with a brief description.
It’s enough to reignite any kid’s (or adult’s) interest in space research and exploration.
 11.
Chipotle Farmers Market (Chipotle)  Fast casual dining favorite Chipotle wants you to know that its ingredients are sourced sustainably and ethically from family farms, so it launched a microsite dedicated to supporting them.
  The Chipotle Farmers Market is a microsite that lists some of the company’s suppliers and links to their websites where you can purchase their products directly.
The site is also a means to advertise the Seed Grants program, which gives $5,000 to 50 farmers under 40.
  Microsite vs.
Website  While microsites are often their own websites, there are a few things that differentiate them from what we usually call websites.
 The main difference between a website and a microsite is its purpose.
An organization’s website often does many things, including explaining its products or services, sharing its values and mission, and selling products.
It’s the main place where visitors, leads, and customers go to learn or do business with you.
It’s also probably built in order to drive conversions and encourage visitors to a purchase.
 Microsites, on the other hand, could be made for a bunch of different reasons.
As Girard explains, microsites are “smaller websites, separate from a company’s corporate website, that enable marketers to quickly build content for and report on the success of a specific initiative.” This initiative could be a campaign, a product launch, an event , or other way to draw in current and potential customers.
Still, all microsites are usually focused on brand awareness or conversion.
They also typically occupy a different domain or subdomain than the primary website.
 Additionally, as their name implies, microsites are typically smaller than full company websites.
As we saw in our examples, a microsite could range in size from one page to several, but almost always fewer pages than the main website it’s related to.
 Microsite vs.
Landing Page  Like microsites, landing pages are focused on a specific goal related to a marketing play.
However, a landing page is not a website — it is a single web page within a website intended to inform visitors about an offering and drive conversions.
 While landing pages feature minimal design to keep visitors focused on generating leads, microsites encourage exploration and engagement.
Microsites aim to build positive connections between people and brands, so visitors are more likely to convert later in their journey.
 Microsites: Small But Mighty  At least when it comes to websites, companies don’t like taking risks.
The goal is to get visitors from landing to conversion to purchase as seamlessly and as quickly as possible.
That’s why businesses spend so much of their resources on design and the user experience.
 But, microsites aren’t a company’s main website — that’s the point.
As a result, they’re some of the coolest projects on the internet.
Microsites are a chance to experiment with new content, promote a unique message, do something offbeat, and, most importantly, create value for visitors.

 Get the resource          Updated: 06/13/22   Published: 01/12/21        This sentence will take you about two seconds to read.
That’s also the longest the average internet user expects to wait for a page to load.
  Two seconds may not seem like very long.
But, when we’re in the flow of browsing, even an extra second of wait time can feel like an inconvenience.
It’s not our fault either — over time, we’ve become used to blazing fast internet speeds.
Our favorite websites spend substantial time and resources tweaking their web pages to load, or perform , as fast as technologically possible.
 Why?
Because page speed affects everything, from user experience, to brand perception, to conversions, to revenue.
Whether you run an ecommerce site, a business website, or a simple blog, every one of your pages has to load, and load times can literally make or break your online business.
 For ideal performance, speed must be considered throughout the design process and monitored regularly.
However, website performance is a deceptively complex topic, and improving it requires special knowledge of what makes a website fast or slow.
  In this guide, we’ll unpack everything you need to know about website performance.
First, we’ll discuss what good web performance looks like and why it’s key for any successful website.
Then, we’ll examine what affects site performance, and how to make sure your website performs as it should.

 Website performance measures how quickly the pages of a website load and display in the web browser.
Web performance optimization is the practice of improving website performance by various methods — faster websites are said to be higher-performing.
 Good website performance is a cornerstone of any successful website because it’s the first event that all visitors experience.
First impressions influence how users feel about a website, its associated business or organization, and whether or not they convert, buy, or bounce.
  Why Website Performance Matters  As an internet user, you’ve experienced many a slow website.
While this might only feel like a minor annoyance, the effects of poor performance can reverberate through an entire business.
From user satisfaction to the company’s bottom line, the consequences are far-reaching.
Let’s cover the speed benchmarks your website is up against, and why they’re so important to hit.
 User Experience  No matter what techniques an online business may use to boost performance, the ultimate goal is always improving the user experience (UX).
All website design choices should foster a positive UX, and speed is no exception.
 UX impacts every aspect of your website.
Simply put, if your website is slow, your visitors will have a bad time.
And if your visitors have a bad time, your online business will have a bad time too.
Conversely, a high-performing site will improve UX, leave a positive impression on visitors, and encourage them to return.
 So, how fast is fast enough for a good experience?
 There’s no definitive benchmark for how fast a website must be.
There have been multiple numbers thrown around, anywhere from five seconds down to half a second, but perhaps the most influential opinion comes from Google.
In 2010 Google stated that a web page must load fully within two seconds for a positive UX, and this is still widely referenced today.
 Note that two seconds is a maximum — the fastest websites can load their content in under a second on average.
If you’re panicking, don’t worry.
With a bit of work, one to two seconds is achievable for almost any website, and certainly for basic ones.
 Two seconds is fast, but not arbitrary.
When visitors engage with your website, they expect to feel in control.
Visitors want your website to deliver exactly what they request as quickly as possible.
It has been shown that the average user can wait roughly two to three seconds before feeling disrupted, like they’ve lost control.
 Over time, we’ve become conditioned to exceptional website performance.
This puts small-time website owners at a disadvantage: When someone lands on your page for the first time, they’re not comparing its load time to those of similar websites — they’re comparing it to the average of every website they’ve seen, including heavy-hitters with entire teams dedicated to performance optimization.
 The good news is that you don’t need a large team to hit the two-second threshold.
There are clear strategies you can follow to speed things up , and soon we’ll examine what exactly causes slow pages.
 Visitor Retention  One main goal of website design is to capture visitor interest as soon as the page loads.
But, none of this matters if your website is slow to load in the first place — it’s very easy for users to leave when they feel impatient.
Research by Akamai Technologies found that two extra seconds of load time more than doubles a page’s bounce rate, and 53% of mobile users will abandon a page that loads in more than three seconds.
 On one hand, it’s great that we’re free to choose the best website for our needs.
On the other, it doesn’t feel so great if you’re the one with the high bounce rate.
To retain visitors, especially first-timers, your website needs to meet performance expectations.
 Conversions and Sales  There’s a strong link between website performance, conversions, and sales .
It doesn’t matter how you define a conversion — performance affects visitor satisfaction, and the happier people are using your website, the more likely they are to download a content offer, join an email list, or complete a purchase.
 Understanding this relationship is key, as it ties your website’s performance with your bottom line.
Small differences in speed can mean the difference between a conversion and a bounce: For every second of load time, your conversion rate is likely to drop by an average of 4.42% within the first three seconds:   Image Source  As marketers know, a conversion lost by you is a conversion gained by a competitor — in this case, a competitor with a faster website.
All the more reason to prioritize speed.
 Brand Perception  Imagine you discover a new restaurant and decide to stop there for lunch.
When you arrive, you notice the front door is busted.
No big deal, they’ll fix it soon, you think.
But, when you return the next week, the door is still broken.
 Sure, you’re bothered by the minor inconvenience.
Worse than that, though, you may start presuming things about the restaurant — if they can’t fix the front door, what does that say about the quality of the food they make?
 The same is true about websites, but to a much greater extent.
A noticeably slow website will stir up assumptions that damage your credibility and brand image.
Visitors will question your competence, security, and ability to serve the customer.
Some might even think your site is unsafe or illegitimate.
Every other website they use is fast, so why not yours?
 Brand perception is a topic for another post .
But, it’s safe to assume that poor perception impedes growth in a competitive online space.
 Mobile Experience  Smartphones are slowly but surely taking over the browsing experience.
The number of worldwide smartphone users recently surpassed three billion with no signs of stopping, and mobile internet browsing is neck-and-neck with desktop browsing.
A quick dip into your analytics may tell a similar story on your website.
 The rise of smartphones is perhaps the greatest sea change in web design of the past decade.
It’s forced companies to reinvent how they build websites, many now opting for a mobile-first design approach that prioritizes small screens  Mobile-first is more than just layout, though.
Mobile devices tend to have fewer computing resources than the standard desktop computer and, as a result, the average web page takes 87% longer to load on mobile than on desktop .
 This doesn’t excuse poor performance, however: Half of mobile users will use a business less often if the site isn’t mobile-friendly , even if they like the business otherwise.
To serve this growing user base, your mobile website must be built lightweight for smaller devices over slow connections.
 SEO  Lastly, website performance has an effect on your place in search results.
Since 2010, Google has factored page speed into its ranking algorithm .
In 2018, it announced the same for mobile pages .
This is one way the search engine rewards websites for providing a better UX.
 While page speed is not currently the most decisive ranking factor (Google states that relevance plays a much larger role), it may still impact your website’s place in search results and affect traffic, conversions, and sales.
For example, if Google sees your website and a competitor's website as equally relevant to a query, the faster of the two may rank higher.
  What Affects Website Performance?
 To most, a website feels like a single entity inside our browsers.
But, website owners know that there’s much more to it than that.
 Many factors come together to deliver a single coherent website, most of which affect web performance in some way.
Here are the main components that determine whether a web page is fast or slow, and how each can be optimized:  Page Weight  Page weight refers to the total size of a web page, comprising all the resources (code files, images, embeds, etc.) it needs to load.
Load time largely depends on weight — essentially, the more files you include and the larger those files are, the more work the browser needs to do to render it.
 Because of how websites are built, many things that slow pages down are based on the frontend, what users see on the page.
Take it from former Google Performance Engineer Steve Souders , who writes, “80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend.”  This idea is illustrated particularly well by a waterfall diagram, one which visualizes how long each resource takes to load completely.
As shown below, frontend content is the culprit on a typical web page:   Image Source  The solution seems simple — trim all excess resources so there’s less to load.
While this works, the problem is that frontend technology is becoming too advanced for its own good.
 For every new element you place on your page, you’re adding time spent loading its resources.
As web professionals are drawn to new dynamic page functions and experiences, load time gets neglected.
This is why, surprisingly, websites have been getting slower despite improvements in page delivery technology.
 Don’t fall for the gimmicks — simplicity is key for both performance and UX, and you should always favor clean layouts over complexity in your designs.
But that’s not the only way to reduce page weight.
 Even after simplifying your pages, you might experience stalls in performance due to large files.
This is where minification comes in.
Minification is the practice of deleting excess characters from files like certain spaces, line breaks, and comments.
This information helps developers read the code files but makes no difference to the browsers processing them.
Minification is possible with online tools, and WordPress users can leverage speed plugins to minify files automatically.
 Images  Most content you see on websites are either text or images.
Images files are much larger than plain text HTML files, so they take longer to download and render in the browser.
It follows that high-fidelity images will impede an otherwise respectable load time.
Luckily, optimizing your images is an easy fix.
 Most importantly, don’t go overboard on the number of images you use across your site.
Each image is another resource to load, so choose yours intentionally.
 Next, resize your images to the desired dimensions before uploading them.
Don’t count on your server or the browser to scale them down as this takes extra time.
It’s better to upload the same image to your server in multiple dimensions, rather than one large image used in different locations on your website.
 Lastly, keep files small by limiting image file formats to JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG whenever possible.
Compressing images may also improve load times, but this is a more subjective process — you want your image files to be small enough to improve performance, but large enough to retain enough quality.
This will take some trial and error, but you’ll tend to find that compressing to around 75% of the original image yields the right balance.
 HTTP Requests  Every website follows the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP.
HTTP dictates that for a website to load in a web browser, the browser must first send an HTTP request to the target website’s hosting server.
The web server then sends back a response with the requested resource.
 In reality, most web pages are complex and require multiple HTTP requests to fully render.
As a rule of thumb, the more complex a web page is, the more HTTP requests it needs.
And the more requests made, the slower the page.
 Reducing HTTP requests may take some time and rethinking of your site, but it could be worth the investment to shave down your load time.
Simplifying a page will reduce the amount of requested resources, so start there if you can.
 Also, be wary of external resources, resources fetched from third-party servers.
External resources can be embeds like images, videos, and other media, as well as external font packs, display ads and affiliate links, and widgets — all require additional HTTP requests to separate servers and may hurt performance.
 Browser Caching  Caching is the process of storing data in a place where it can be more easily fetched in the future.
A browser cache saves website data like HTML files and images temporarily on the user’s device.
When the user returns to the cached web page, the browser loads these files from its local cache instead of requesting them from the web server, saving time and bandwidth.
 Browser caching is a must for content that is static on your website for longer periods (content that changes frequently should not be cached).
How you enable caching will depend on what services you use to build and host your site, but every provider should offer instructions and explain how to set time limits for cached content.
 File Compression  File compression helps deliver files quickly over the web.
A web server with compression enabled shrinks down the requested files (without loss of information) before sending them.
When a browser receives the compressed files, it decompresses them and renders them as normal.
 Smaller files are faster to send and download, so compression is almost always beneficial.
Today, 80% of websites use compression, specifically a type of compression called GZIP.
Learn how to enable GZIP compression on your server .
 Render-Blocking CSS and JavaScript  Web browsers process each page resource one-by-one.
Sometimes this means that a file’s code prevents future assets from loading quickly — this is referred to as render-blocking code.
 Render-blocking code is typically CSS or JavaScript that, by default, loads before the rest of the page content, even if this code isn’t required for above-the-fold content (i.e. content first visible when the page first loads) to work.
Developers can remove or defer render-blocking code to give the impression of better performance.
 Hosting  While the majority of web performance optimization practices address the frontend of your website, the right web host is the foundation of a successful, high-performing website.
A poor server is subject to flaws and performance issues, so it’s worth the investment for hosting that can handle increasing traffic and spikes in requests.
 The low cost of shared hosting may be tempting, but know you’ll be splitting server resources with many other websites — increased activity on any of them affects performance on yours.
Choosing a plan above shared hosting will help keep your pages fast at all times.
 Geographic Location  With all this tech-speak, it’s easy to forget that servers are computers located somewhere in the world.
The larger the distance between the device making HTTP requests and your server(s) completing the requests, the longer your website files will take to send and load.
This is why it’s important to know where your servers are being pinged from — your website will likely perform differently in Washington D.C. versus Tokyo.
 You can remedy this problem with a content delivery network (CDN) .
A CDN is a collection of servers distributed around the world that hold cached copies of your website files.
When a user requests your website, your CDN will determine the server closest to their physical location and deliver the files from that server.
 Permanent Redirects  301 redirects send users from the page they requested to another.
As you can guess, the time spent redirecting visitors detracts from performance.
There’s not much you can do about this once the redirect is in place, so it’s best to avoid 301s when you can.
  How to Check Website Performance  The first step of website performance optimization is measuring how fast your website currently runs.
The best way to do this is by conducting an online speed test of your web pages.
 These free tests let you paste in the URL of any webpage, and will return a summary of the page performance.
Many tests also produce an aggregate score quantifying the overall performance of the page and a rundown of which areas contributed most to a fast or slow performance, so you can pinpoint the most outstanding issues on your website and achieve some quick performance wins.
 We’ve listed a few of these speed tests below.
As you pick one, keep the following in mind:   Every tool calculates your performance score differently, so stick to one tool.
Viewing results across different tools may give a false impression of improvement.
 Run multiple tests to simulate performance when your website is both cached and uncached by the speed testing tool.
Cached websites load faster than uncached ones, so if your website underperforms on your first test, this may be why.
 Your site doesn’t need a perfect score to be considered high-performing — it may not even be possible depending on the resources your page needs.
Aim as close to perfect as you reasonably can.
  Website Grader  Website Grader provides an aggregate performance score out of 100 which encapsulates the effectiveness of your website.
Scoring factors include performance as well as SEO, mobile experience, and security.
 Powered by Google’s open-source Lighthouse tool, Website Grader’s performance assessment accounts for 30% of your website score and examines key contributors like page size, number of HTTP requests, caching, and image size.
There’s also a free accompanying video course to help you improve your grade.
  PageSpeed Insights  Another popular testing option for marketers, Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool assesses your website performance on both mobile and desktop devices.
It provides an aggregate score from 0 to 100 and is powered by Lighthouse — a score of 80 or above is considered high-performing.
 PageSpeed Insights is notably rigorous and holds websites up to high standards in terms of performance.
It also provides a detailed but accessible report of important metrics, as well as opportunities — suggestions for speeding up your page — and additional diagnostics which may be helpful.
  Image Source  Pulsetic  Pulsetic is a global website monitoring tool that provides insight on your website performance including website speed, typical website maintenance, and other customizable reporting ranging from setting headers to response timeouts.
For websites with multiple languages and regions, reports will include detailed regional information like uptime and response times.
 All of Pulsetic tools allows you to run tests and receive website downtime alerts by phone call, SMS, email, or Slack if your website is down   Image Source  Pingdom  Pingdom is a website monitoring tool that also offers a free website speed test.
Its results center on changes you can make to boost performance, and it assigns letter grades to each component enhancing or detracting from load time.
It breaks down transfer sizes by file type and number of HTTP requests per content type  Also, Pingdom allows you to run tests from several global locations to simulate how your site performs in these regions.
  Image Source  GTmetrix  The GTmetrix performance test is one more Lighthouse-powered option — it gives an in-depth summary of performance and suggestions for improvement.
It also includes a helpful speed visualization (a timeline of screenshots marking each significant load time event), a content waterfall, video recordings of its tests, and historical performance data for tracking improvements over time.
  Image Source  WebPageTest  WebPageTest is an open-source testing tool that assesses web performance and security.
It runs performance tests on multiple browsers and lets you test from multiple global locations.
Less intuitive than other tools, WebPageTest is better for web experts than those seeking quick wins or a brief user-friendly summary.
Specifically, its performance breakdown is highly-detailed and its report may take longer to assess than reports with other tools.
  Image Source   Website Performance Metrics  After putting your website through one of the tools above, you might be unfamiliar with some of the terms used to measure performance.
While speed is an intuitive concept, performance can’t really be summed up by a single value — there are multiple indicators that web developers use to quantify how “fast” a page actually is.
Knowing them, you’ll have a better understanding of how to approach optimization.
 Page Load Time  Page load time is the time it takes to load an entire web page completely.
It is measured from when a user requests a website (e.g. enters a URL in the browser or clicks a link on a search results page) to when the last resource on the page is rendered.
When we say that websites should load in two to three seconds maximum, this is the metric we’re referencing.
 Time to First Byte  Time to first byte (TTFB) measures the latency of your web server.
It is the time between when a user requests your website and when your web server sends back the first piece of information to the user’s browser.
 A slow TTFB indicates an issue with your web server, which can be resolved by upgrading or changing your server plan, or by using a CDN.
But first, you’re probably better off focusing on metrics that deal in the frontend, such as...
 Time to Start Render  Time to start render is the time it takes for content to begin displaying on the page after a request for the website is sent.
It measures how long it takes before the user knows that content is being loaded.
This can be signaled by any visual element — like a header, a block of text, or the background — appearing on screen.
 This is an important metric, as it tells users that their request is being processed and they’ll see your website soon, which holds their attention.
Time to start render usually takes one to two seconds, but top-performing websites hit this mark in under a second.
 Time to Title  Time to title is the time it takes for the title of your website to appear in the browser tab, which tells the visitor that your website is loading.
The faster the title appears, the better.
 Time to Interactive  Another key website performance indicator, time to interactive measures the time from when a user requests your website to when they can start interacting with elements on the page, like scrolling or clicking buttons.
 This doesn’t mean that the page is fully loaded — some page elements may still load after others become interactive.
Still, if a user can interact with content above the fold, they will consider the page ready to use.
 DNS Lookup Time  DNS lookup time is how long it takes for the Domain Name System (DNS) to convert the domain name entered by the user into the corresponding IP address.
This must be done to retrieve the resources from each hosting server.
 DNS lookup should be very short, no more than 150 milliseconds — anything longer can noticeably impact performance.
A lengthy DNS lookup time could be caused by your DNS provider, in which case you might consider a premium DNS service.
It may also be due to the number of third-party resources on your web page.
For example, if your page includes content from two third-party resources, the DNS will need to translate three domains (including your own) into IP addresses, inflating your total DNS lookup time.
 User-Based Metrics  These metrics aren’t direct measurements of website performance, but can be good indicators.
If you see these dwindling, look into your page speeds.
 Bounce Rate  A page’s bounce rate is the percentage of people who land on the page, then leave without clicking anything.
If a page is slow to load, it makes sense that a higher number of visitors will be impatient and leave without interacting.
But, remember that high bounce rates can be caused by many things — your page might load fine but fail to capture interest.
 Session Duration  Session duration (also called “time on site”) is another sign of potentially slow pages.
If it skews very low, this may indicate that many users aren’t getting past the first-page load.
 Conversion Rate  Conversion rate is the percentage of the total visitors to your website that complete a conversion.
As discussed, conversions are closely linked to website performance — happy visitors are more likely to stay on your website and complete some desired action.
Like bounce rate, many factors influence your conversion rate, but it’s worth investigating to see if performance is one of them.
 Error Rate  Error rate is the proportion of HTTP requests that return error codes among all HTTP requests over a short period.
A high error rate indicates something is wrong with your web infrastructure that prevents resources from being delivered, slowing or stalling pages and turning visitors away.
  Website Performance Monitoring Tools  After resolving any current outstanding performance issues, it’s recommended you monitor your website performance on a regular basis.
This means checking that your website continues to load pages quickly and consistently.
 Website performance monitoring comes in two types, real user monitoring and synthetic monitoring.
Real user monitoring, also called passive monitoring or reactive monitoring, tracks user activity and records in detail how your website performs for real users.
Synthetic monitoring, also called active monitoring or proactive monitoring, uses software to simulate real user interactions at routine intervals.
This helps uncover performance issues before they affect real visitors.
 Both real user monitoring and synthetic monitoring require specialized monitoring software, and several cloud-based solutions exist for active and reactive monitoring.
Here are some standout options:  Pingdom  Pingdom is a top player among website monitoring tools, and is acclaimed for its reliability and up-to-the-minute alerts issued when your website is down or performing below benchmarks.
This service also offers synthetic monitoring to discover performance problems and a user-friendly interface that allows website owners of any experience level to keep tabs on their sites.
 Pingdom prices its service on a scale and splits its plan into synthetic and real user monitoring services.
Synthetic monitoring starts at $10 per month for 10 uptime checks (i.e. checking that your website is available) and one advanced page speed check.
Real user monitoring starts at $10 per month for 100,000 page views.
  Image Source  Uptrends  Uptrends is another popular monitoring tool that includes solutions for proactive and reactive website monitoring.
It allows you to automate performance tests from 224 global locations in intervals of up to one minute, and its visual reports are highly intuitive and visually engaging.
If you want a tool that shows you everything you need to know in a simple interface, try a demo.
 Uptrends is priced across five tiers, from the Starter plan ($15.47 per month) and the Business plan ($37.06 per month) up to the Professional plan ($216.65 per month).
Features vary widely per plan, allowing you to select one best suited and switch plans as your website scales.
  Image Source  Site24x7  Site24x7 provides a comprehensive suite of tools for website monitoring as well as server monitoring, application performance monitoring, and more.
You can leverage its global network of over 100 monitoring locations to simulate web page interactions and track your site’s performance and uptime.
Site24x7 can also conduct security audits and API monitoring — it’s a lot to take in, which may make this powerful option feel overwhelming for new users  Plans range from $9 per month to $89 per month with increasing permitted websites and synthetic tests and pageviews by tier.
There’s also an enterprise plan and a 30-day free trial.
  Image Source  TeamViewer  The TeamViewer Remote Management tool (previously Montis) is our final recommendation.
It’s centered on page performance — you can check page speeds from over 30 global locations and generate visual reports for each check.
Performance checks can be set to run as frequently as you want, and you can also program alerts if performance drops below a set threshold.
One drawback is that the user interface isn’t as striking as competitors.
 The price of a TeamViewer subscription scales based on the number of tracked URLs — for example, 10 URLs is $18.55 per month, while 100 URLs will run you $153 per month.
  Image Source  Improve Your Website Speed  Every website takes a different approach to its design based on its goals, industry, and audience.
However, good website performance is a universal must for all websites, no matter the niche, service, or content.
 Slow load times are more than just an annoyance for your users — they impact how your audience views your brand and how likely they are to make a purchase and recommend you to a friend.
A slow website is also bad for SEO and mobile traffic.
And, if your pages perform poorly, every single visitor is affected.
 To sum up, website performance optimization more than just making things faster — it’s about strengthening your entire online presence and creating a website that visitors trust.
While major performance gains may not happen overnight, the data shows that fractions of a second make all the difference.

(And Should You Use One?)   May 08, 2023                       20 of the Best Interactive Websites [+ How to Make Your Own]    Visit HubSpot's Website Theme Marketplace        Anna Fitzgerald     Published: January 05, 2024       The best websites are designed with users in mind.
Interactive websites are particularly successful at user-centered design .
They are not only personalized and playful — they also give users control over their experience and help guide them toward information they want.
  Visitors on interactive websites are invited to scroll, click on navigation items, view portfolio items, and participate in other ways.
The result is a more engaged and memorable user experience .
 In this post, we’ll take a look at more than a dozen interactive websites that can inspire your own web design .
Then, we’ll walk through some actionable steps you can take to make your site interactive.
  Interactive Websites  Interactive websites either respond to a user’s interaction or guide the user journey with captivating animations, videos, and other interactive elements (like on this homepage ).
This type of website does more than delight users — it helps keep them engaged on the site for longer.
Here are some of the best examples of interactive design.
 1.
Fern   Fern is an Atlanta-based animation and design studio that specializes in  animation, illustration, and storytelling.
Their website offers multiple ways for visitors to interact, including horizontal scrolling , animated text, GIFs, and video backgrounds.
 You’ll find one of the most unique interactive elements when you scroll down to their Archives.
It seems like a simple table with the name of the brand the agency worked with and a short description of the project.
But when you hover over one of these names or descriptions, the cursor reveals a short animated clip that’s basically a trailer of the project.
It’s the perfect combination of interactive and informative.
 2.
Earth Month With A Redwood   Earth Month With A Redwood is a microsite for Redwood Empire Whiskey.
Designed and developed by Affinity Creative, its purpose was to educate and incentivize customers to enter the Redwood Glamping Experience Sweepstakes.
 Earth Month With A Redwoof not only invites users to interact with the site — it requires it.
When you land on the homepage, you are invited to “plant your seed.” You have to slide the rotating element into the glass to essentially unlock the rest of the site.
Once you do, the background will be replaced by a hand drawn map.
At the bottom, you’ll see a scrolling banner that invites you to enter the sweepstakes or share it on Facebook or Instagram to increase your own chances.
Once you hover over the banner, it stops scrolling.
As you scroll, you’ll notice plenty of additional interactive elements.
 3.
Eamonn Day Lavelle   Eamonn Day Lavelle provides an excellent example of a simple interactive portfolio website.
If you click “View Projects,” you are automatically scrolled down to a list of his projects.
If you click on any individual project, then you are redirected to a more comprehensive landing page.
Thanks to a fade-in transition effect , the page fades in and changes background color to visually depict the loading process.
 The best part about this site is that it’s optimized for performance.
Coded with HTML5 and CSS3 and weighing less than 8MB, the site loads incredibly fast.
This proves that interactive design and website performance don’t have to be tradeoffs.
 4.
Whiteboard   Whiteboard is a creative agency that drives strategy, designs brands, develops websites, builds apps, and launches campaigns, among other responsibilities.
Its website is a treasure trove of interaction.
You’ll find parallax scrolling , fly-in animations, hover animations, and much more.
 For example, if you scroll down the page, you’ll find a unique portfolio section that looks like a collage board with images.
If you hover over any of the individual images, then the image becomes a white text box with the brand’s name and an invitation to view the project, and the background becomes a full-width image from the case study.
 5.
Foot Locker's Home Game  Foot Locker’s Home Game is a microsite designed and developed by CTHDRL.
Its purpose was to inform and incentivize visitors to participate in a virtual basketball and sneaker contest on Twitter.
Fans had to follow along on social and then enter gated challenges to win exclusive sneakers, merch, and experiences.
 The site excelled in capturing visitor’s attention and sustaining it.
The first thing visitors see is a colorful background that looks a bit like a basketball court.
Elements that look like paper cutouts of basketball hoops, sneakers, and Foot Locker gift cards continuously rain down the screen.
There are CTA buttons encouraging users to “Follow Along” throughout the page.
These buttons turn a different color and rotate when users hover over them.
When scrolling through the section called “The Drops,” cards appear as the reader scrolls showing which prizes were available.
 6.
(UN)TRAFFICKED  (UN)TRAFFICKED is an interactive digital story created to draw attention to the child trafficking crisis in India.
Based on the choose-your-own-adventure format, this interactive site has users follow a 13 year old girl through a life-changing week and make decisions throughout that will impact the outcome of the story.
(For example, you start by giving the girl a name.) A soundtrack, in which you can literally hear the girl’s heart breaking, and up-to-date statistics on the state of child labour and sexual abuse in India are featured throughout.
After “playing” the game, users are encouraged to continue taking action by signing the pledge and sharing on social media.
 As the digital centerpiece of a large-scale campaign by the Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation to end child exploitation in India, (UN)TRAFFICKED shows how powerful interactive web design can be.
 7.
Cyclemon  Cyclemon is an interactive illustrated website created by two French designers.
This website allows users to cycle through (get it?) different bike models paired with different identities: traveller, weirdo, hipster, and swagger are just a few.
They can stop scrolling whenever they see a description or model that suits them.
Parallax scrolling gives the illusion of travelling through the different places in the background, which include a hotel, amusement park, and ferry, among others.
 The catch: the bikes aren’t actually for sale.
But the designs are.
 8.
Bragg  Bragg — short for Bragg Live Foods — is a health food company that’s dedicated to helping each individual eat better, feel better, and enjoy a more healthful and vibrant life.
Bragg takes this personalized approach to its website as well.
 As users hover over different elements, they change colors or move on the page.
For example, there’s an interactive timeline that invites users to learn about the major landmarks in the company’s history, starting with its founding date.
Then there’s a product slider.
If a user hovers over one of the products, then more information appears thanks to the slide-in animation, including the product name, star rating, size availability and price.
The user can click on another available size and the price will automatically change.
 9.
Violet   Violet is a company dedicated to making culturally competent health care accessible for all communities.
Its website is characterized by bold colors and typography, animations, and illustrations.
 Scrolling down the page, you’ll notice elements rotate as you scroll past them or the background color changes.
Once you get close to the Library section, vertical scrolling changes to horizontal scrolling.
The illustrated icons of each resource will also grow if you hover over them.
The overall effect of the design is a personalized user experience, much like the company hopes all communities can receive from the health care system.

Decatur Dan   Dan Hall, better known as Decatur Dan, is a famous music video director who now creates visual stories for brands like Nike and Beats by Dre.
His portfolio site — also developed by CTHDRL — exemplifies his visual storytelling skills.
Inviting users to share his commitment to what’s bigger, greater, and better, his website allows users to drag and resize all elements on the page.
As a result, users can remix his work into their own layout.
 11.
Delve Architects   Delve Architects is a London-based company that aims to bring a light-hearted and personable approach to architectural design.
These two values are reflected in its website’s design.
 The color palette is mostly made up of light pastels.

Clicking on one of the color blocks will reveal an image and category, so users can view their projects, learn more about their practice, read their blog, or contact them with enquiries.
 12.
Cycles Gladiator  Cycles Gladiator is a California-based wine company dedicated to inspiring and empowering women.
This interactive one page website invites users to locate a nearby retailer or restaurant that sells their wines, learn more about their partnership with the non-profit group Do More Art, and join their mailing list.
Each of these calls-to-action has a button with a subtle hover animation.
At the bottom of the page, there is a slider so users can view their wine collection one bottle (or can) at a time.
 13.
Daniel See  Daniel See is the Principal National Creative Director for Deloitte Digital Australia.
Since he’s been working in the digital industry for over two decades, he has a lot of projects to showcase.

 14.
Portfolio Night  Portfolio Night is a microsite created by AKQA Amsterdam to invite aspiring creatives to attend their event.
The site is designed with the goals of the event in mind: one, for aspiring creatives to cross paths with the AKQA Amsterdam team and two, to get practical and actionable feedback on their portfolios.
That’s why there’s a “worm” on the homepage that’s made up of projects from portfolios.
As the user scrolls, the worm rotates and spans across the screen so it continuously crosses the user’s path.
It also moves when the user hovers over it.
 This provides a truly unique example of an interactive portfolio section.
 15.
Prometheus Fuels   Prometheus Fuels invites readers to dive into an interactive story to learn how their company is creating fuel from the air.
It’s basically part website, part video game.
When users hover over the background, the car moves as if by game controller.
If they hold the spacebar, they’ll see and hear the car accelerate.
As the user scrolls and the car accelerates, bits of the story will be revealed.
   How to Make Interactive Websites    Create a loading animation.
 Make scrolling fun.
 Leverage hover animations.
 Incorporate video.
 Add carousels.
     1.
Create a loading animation.
 Loading animations are a great way to capture and keep the user’s attention immediately.
Not only do they reassure users that the page is loading, they can also show off your brand personality and delight users.
Many loading animations will indicate how long it will take for the page to load, which makes the waiting time seem shorter and makes users less likely to bounce.
 Below is a simple and effective example.

Make scrolling fun.
 You want to make it as fun as possible for users to browse your site and discover your content.
Scrolling patterns can help.
Let’s briefly go over the most popular options below:   Horizontal scrolling: This scrolling pattern allows the user to scroll left and right to reveal content from the sides of the window or container — instead of up and down, which is a more traditional orientation.
 Infinite scroll: With this type of long scrolling, content continually loads once a user reaches the bottom of the page.
Pinterest is one of — if not the — most well-known sites for using this scrolling pattern.
 P arallax scrolling: This scrolling pattern creates an illusion of depth.
Basically, some elements are either fixed in place or set to scroll slower while other elements on the page scroll normally.
This makes it look like some elements are moving in front of others, which simulates 3D movement.
  Here’s an example of dynamic scrolling on a portfolio site:   Image Source  3.
Leverage hover animations.
 Another type of animation that can delight your visitors is hover animations.
When a user hovers over an animated element like a button for example, it can change color, grow, shrink, rotate, and more, depending on how you coded it.
Like loading animations, hover animations are enjoyable for the visitor and assure them that your site is working.
 Here’s a great example of a hover animation that makes the primary CTA more clickable.
  Image Source  4.
Incorporate video.
 Since many users are more likely to play, share, and otherwise interact with videos than text, incorporating videos is an easy and effective way to make your website interactive.
It can also help boost conversions.
In fact, 83% of video marketers say video has helped them generate leads.
 Taking interactive web design to a whole new level, Nikolaj Juhlsen used video to literally show visitors how it feels to take a ride.
  Image Source  5.
Add carousels.
 A carousel — or carousel slider — is a slideshow for presenting a series of content.
When done right , a carousel slider is a great way to organize serial content or multiple, separate pieces of content, like images.
It can also boost user engagement and provide a better experience by allowing visitors to quickly and easily navigate this content, especially on mobile.
 Here’s an example of a product carousel that encourages user interaction:   Image Source  How will your website interact with visitors?
 Interactive websites can provide a more playful, personalized, and engaging experience to online consumers.
The good news is that there are actionable steps you can take to add more interactivity to your site right away.
You might add a video, re-organize a product display into a carousel, or create a loading animation, depending on your skillset and target audience.

bentsen)            15 Animated Cursor Effects & Ideas for Your Website [+How to Build Your Own]    Download Now: Free HTML & CSS Coding Templates        Anna Fitzgerald     Published: February 06, 2024       When I think of the mid-2010s internet, I think about Tumblr.
This magical online platform allowed (and still allows) you to build a personalized blog.
  You could code it yourself or choose from a number of themes.
When I kicked off my blog, I wanted to get my aesthetic just right.
That included a heart-shaped animated cursor that alternated between colors of the rainbow.
 While the days of bold (often blindingly colorful) Tumblr blogs may be behind us, animated cursors still have a place in the modern web.
A cursor in a custom shape or with custom animation on click can add visual intrigue, enhancing the user experience .
  Below, we’ll explore cursor effects that can level up your site.
Then, we’ll explore when to use animated cursors.
 Table of Contents   What is a cursor, anyway?
 Types of Cursor Effects  Cursor Effect Ideas  How to Make an Animated Cursor    What is a cursor, anyway?
 Cursors convey where a user’s mouse is on a site and what actions they can take.
 For example, when hovering over a table element, the cursor may change to a double-sided arrow, indicating that they can resize a row or column.
When attempting to drag and drop an image, the cursor may change to an X, indicating that the action is prohibited.
 Cursors can be animated to add interactivity to the user’s browsing experience.
These cursors may have unusual shapes, change upon clicks, or shift between colors.
The site below has an animated cursor and multiple options people can use on their own sites.
  Image Source  A fun cursor, like a lollipop rose or a cute cat, can be a great choice for your personal blog.
However, not every website needs a fun cursor.
And if you do opt for that additional flair, it needs to match your brand.
Below, we’ll share examples of creative cursors in use.
  Types of Cursor Effects  Custom cursors are popular in website design because they provide an opportunity to wow visitors who are expecting the default mouse pointer of their operating system.
They’re especially popular on creative websites, like agency and designer portfolios.
Below are real websites with unique cursor effects.
 1.
Swirl Cursor Effect   Image Source  Advanced Team uses an advanced cursor effect that makes the user’s scrolling path look like a disturbance of rainbow-colored water.
This helps the user keep track of where they are on the web page and adds unique splashes to this black-and-white website design.
 What we like: The rainbow swirl cursor effect is a great contrast against the stark black background.
 2.
Flashlight Cursor Effect   Image Source  On Moooi’s interactive site Paper Play, users scroll through various “immersive layers” which feature different products.
On one layer that features the Dandelion Cranes Wallcovering, the cursor has a flashlight effect so the user can illuminate different elements on the page.
 What we like: The flashlight cursor effect provides the user with control over their scrolling experience.
 3.
Distort Cursor Effect   Image Source  Utsobo is one of the coolest interactive websites .
As users move their cursor over the page, the background distorts, becoming larger and darker.
Users are actually invited to “draw on the page” by holding and dragging their cursor.
This will temporarily freeze the cursor effect so it looks like brushstrokes on a painting.
 What we like: The distort cursor effect creates a unique interactive experience, making the user feel like they’re already part of a collaborative design process.
 4.
Dot Cursor Effect   Image Source  Thinkingbox has a unique orange dot cursor with a shadow effect.
This transforms into a white circle with an orange eye icon when hovering over video thumbnails on the page.
It’s a great way to communicate to visitors that these are videos, not images.
 What we like: This cursor effect subtly differentiates videos from other elements on the page.
 5.
Following Cursor Effect   Image Source  Tappezzeria Novecento has a unique cursor made up of two circles: One acts like the default mouse pointer, and the other looks like a shadow effect but starts to “follow” the cursor as it moves around the page.
This effect makes the cursor more prominent so users can more easily locate where they are and move around the content-rich site.
 What we like: The following cursor effect makes it easier for readers to navigate around this bold, content-heavy website.
 6.
Text Cursor Effect   Image Source  On CraieCraie’s website, the cursor is a black dot that aligns perfectly with the logo.
When hovering over a portfolio image, however, the black dot transforms into a transparent circle containing a word.
In the screenshot above, you’ll notice the cursor contains the word découvrir, which means “to discover” or "to uncover.” This invites users to learn more about this specific project.
 What we like: The text cursor effect helps inform the user what they can do next on the site.
 7.
Arrow Cursor Effect   Image Source  Mutt Agency uses cursor effects to improve the navigability of its unique portfolio website.
As the user scrolls toward the top or bottom of the page, the cursor becomes an arrow to guide the user on where to go next.
 What we like: The arrow cursor effect helps guide the user’s journey and encourage them to keep browsing.
 8.
Spinning Cursor Effect   Image Source  thePenTool combines hover animations and cursor effects to help users browse the different products they offer.
When a user hovers over a product, the background color changes, and the cursor becomes a ballpoint pen at the center of a black circle.
The circle also contains spinning text that encourages users to check out the product.
 What we like: The spinning cursor effect helps draw the user’s attention to each individual product.
 9.
Fade-in Cursor Effect   Image Source  SIX SOCKS has one of the most unique cursor effects.
When you first land on the site, the mouse pointer is surrounded by spinning text that says “click and drag.” When you do so, elements based on the design of the cards appear.
 What we like: The fade-in cursor effect is a unique and interactive way to provide users with a glimpse of what the product looks like.
 10.
Trailing Cursor Effect   Image Source  PPP uses a trailing cursor effect to mark the user’s scrolling path.
As you move around the page, a series of colorful circles will trail behind the cursor.
It recalls the retro snake computer game — but with a modern and playful twist.
This is exactly on brand with PPP, which aims to design experiences that combine play and gamification.
 What we like: The trailing cursor effect not only improves navigation — it’s also perfectly on brand.

 Access now     Learn more            Cursor Effect Ideas  Here are some cursor effect ideas for inspiration to implement on your website.
Below are ideas sourced from CodePen so you can easily copy and paste the code.
 1.
Shadow Cursor  See the Pen Animated cursor with Kinet by Georgy Marchuk ( @gmrchk ) on CodePen .
  In the example above, the default mouse pointer has a blue shadow.
It trails the pointer as it moves, then wobbles back into place when the pointer stills.
 What we like: This colorful cursor helps users easily locate where they are on a black-and-white website.
 Example use cases: The ball in the image is bouncy and fun.
If your brand sells products that are creative or appeal to kids, this can be an engaging addition to your site.
If dots are a part of your logo, a dot may also be a natural fit.
 2.
Animated Icon Cursor on Hover  See the Pen Animated cursor on :hover by Nharox ( @Nharox ) on CodePen .
  Above, you’ll see the default mouse pointer of your OS — unless you’re hovering over one of the colorful blocks.
Then, the cursor becomes animated, starting as an “X” icon and rotating until it’s a white plus icon in a circle.
 What we like: This cursor subtly differentiates clickable elements from the background of the web page.
 Example use cases: The cursor clearly shows what users can click on and what they are not able to interact with.
If your site offers learning material or how-to guides, a cursor like this can make the navigation experience intuitive.
 3.
Trailing Cursor  See the Pen React Animated Custom Cursor by Stephen Scaff ( @StephenScaff ) on CodePen .
  This cursor combines the purposes of the two examples above.
The red dot cursor is trailed by a semi-transparent dot when moving.
However, it turns into a shadow when the cursor lands on a link.
 What we like: This cursor makes the scrolling experience more engaging and differentiates links from text.
 Example use cases: Clean and easy to understand, this cursor is a great fit for any site looking to level up engagement.
 Pro tip: Make sure that the color of your cursor contrasts with the background color of your site.
If your site has a dark background, light colors will provide greater contrast and be easy to see.
If your site has a light background, do the inverse.
 4.
Expanding Cursor on Hover  See the Pen Animated Cursor + link hover effect by roeslein ( @roesinn ) on CodePen .
  In the CodePen above, the cursor begins as a white circle.
When hovering over one of the words, the white circle expands.
The cursor becomes a hand pointer with a white shadow.
Against the black background of the web page, the cursor looks like it’s a spotlight.
 What we like: This cursor effect makes the text representing different navigation options the focal point on hover.
 Example use cases: This effect may be overwhelming if you have a site with many links within a body paragraph.
However, if you only want to highlight a few links in text and multiple throughout your navigation bar, this cursor may fit your project well.
 Pro tip: Make sure your text has the right contrast for your desired effect.
For example, in the CodePen above, there is white text on a white background that only appears when you hover the cursor over it.
This can be used to surprise your visitors.
However, this effect won’t work for every site.
 If you want to know how to code this type of animated cursor from scratch, check out this video by CodeGrid.
                                           How to Make an Animated Cursor  You have two options for making an animated cursor.
You can use an editor, like IcoFX, to make an animated cursor for your operating system or code one from scratch and embed it on your website.
The latter requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is best for experienced developers.
 For users with less technical experience, let’s walk through how to create an animated cursor with the IcoFX editor.
 How to Make an Animated Cursor With IcoFX  The IcoFX allows you to create a custom cursor or customize one of their preloaded animated cursors.
Below, we’ll outline the process for creating a custom cursor.
 1.

 5.
Use the “Image/Animation/Frame Rate…” menu item to change the frame rate.
 6.
Use the “Image/Cursor/Hot Spot…” menu item to set the hot spot of your cursor.
  7.
Use the “Image/Cursor/Test Cursor…” menu item to test it.
  8.
When you’re ready, use the “File/Save…” menu item to save it.

 Every day, a huge amount of dogs become available for adoption in the USA and Canada.
The newest ones are put on display in this little town, to give them extra attention and hopefully a (new) home soon.
 This is a project by Stutpak (design / audio) and Luuk (code).
The animal data is provided by the amazing RescueGroups organisation.
 So, go ahead and spot all the dogs that are having a break here! You can click tap on them to see more information.
Don't forget to turn on your sound…  After closing this popup, use your mouse to drag and zoom swipe the screen to navigate through the town.
On every visit, a different dog will take the spotlight.
 The town switches to "dark mode" around 6 pm "light mode" around 6 am , and is updated four times a day with new data.
Oh, and can you find the easter egg?
  ?
                   何をやってもいい、  自分なりの極みに行けば、  みな同じ道に通じている     It doesn’t matter what you choose, all Truth leads to the same path.
      頭を低く、目は高く、  ⼝慎んで、心は広く、  孝を原点として他を益す。     "Keep your head down, your eyes high, your mouth narrow, your mind wide, and your thoughts at the origin for the benefit of others.
      神技に達することは、  その神技自体よりも、その過程が、  人間にとって大切なのである。     It is the process of reaching the divine art that is more important to man than the art itself.
      カネを失うことは小さいことである。  信を失うことは大きいことである。  覇気を失うことは己れを失うことである。     Losing money is a small thing.
To lose faith is a great thing.
To lose courage is to lose oneself.
      たえず前進する勇気こそが、  技でもなく、知でもなく、  最終的な勝利を得るための鍵なのである。     The courage to keep going is the key, not to skills, not to knowledge, but to the final victory.
      信じられるものがあるというのは、  何よりもゆるぎない正義だ。     Having something to believe in is the most unshakable justice of all.

     精神と肉体の完全なる調和を目指すのが、極真の道である。  精神と肉体の完全なる調和を目指すのが、極真の道である。        決して現状に満足せず、常に高みを目指し、心と体の両面から自己研鑽に励みつづける。この茨の道を生涯にわたって歩み続けた男がいた。その名は、大山倍達。己の人生のすべてを空手に注ぎ、現代空手の礎を築いた男である。この唯一無二の男が、己の命を賭して世界に示し続けたのが『極真』であった。 しかし、極真とは空手道だけを表すのではない。 自らが選択した道の果てを垣間見んと欲し、命を躍動させ高みを目指す。そして、果てに至っても尚、現状に見切りをつけず、さらに道を切り拓いていこうとする精神を指す。芸術、学問、スポーツ、料理…。あらゆる道に、この終わりなき極真の精神は存在しうる。その精神の大切さや偉大さを改めて世の中に伝えたい。そして、大山倍達に変わって現代を鼓舞していきたい。 願わくば、今を生きるすべての人が一心不乱に物事に打ち込み、心を弾ませながら一日一日を謳歌できるよう、彼の歩んだ歴史や言葉から溢れ出た心意気をまとめたいと思う。  Never satisfied, Mas Oyama constantly strived to achieve a higher level of mastery of mind and body.
Through a lifelong dedication to the thorny path of disciplined martial arts training, through devotion and self-sacrifice to the art, he laid the foundation for modern karate and spread the art of Kyokushin Karate world-wide.
For Mas Oyama the idea of "Kyokushin" was not limited to karate.
This limitless spirit of Kyokushin is at the heart of every path - it can be found in the sciences and arts of education, sport, music, cooking...The target of Kyokushin is to catch a glimpse of the ultimate - the culmination of the path one has chosen - this is achieved by exerting a great deal of energy and results in a total vitalization of one's life.
Even after reaching the mastery of his art, Mas Oyama remained tireless in his pursuit of further evolution of his karate.
Kyokushin also refers to the spirit of never giving up on the pursuit of growth, and the carving out of a path forwards.
"I would like to convey the importance and a deep greatness of the spirit of Kyokushin to the world, in my high-hopes to inspire this modern world of today and to humbly share the life experiences of the path I have taken.
It is my sincerest intention to help some, if not all readers in some way.
” - Founder of IKO Kyokushinkaikan and Kyokushin Karate Masutatsu Oyama                             Biography   Longing for strength awakened at the age of nine.
     若干九歳で目覚めた「強さ」への憧れ。  若干九歳で目覚めた「強さ」への憧れ。        幼少期の大山倍達はどこにでもいる特別な存在になりたい少年だった。映画を見ては忍者に憧れ通信教育の気合術に励み、ビスマルク伝を読んでは政治に携わりたいと大望を抱く、そんな夢見がちな少年だった。 そんな大山に転機が訪れたのは、小柄な中年が巨漢を一瞬で打ち倒した神技を見た9歳の頃であった。以降大山は「強さ」に特別な思いを抱き様々な格闘技を学ぶ。その中に後に生涯を共にする空手があった。大山は几帳面で生真面目、一人で何時間も稽古を続ける我慢強さを持ち、病に伏せっていた師を見舞い差し入れをする義理堅さもあり目上の人物に可愛がられた。  As a child, Masutatsu Oyama was a normal boy who felt he had a calling to be something big.
He was a dreamy boy who watched movies, longed to be a ninja, and worked hard at his correspondence course in Kiai-jutsu( a type of martial art discipline, training one’s supernatural power or magic in Japan).
Later years he read the Bismarck biography and had great ambitions to be involved in politics and the military.
The turning point for Oyama came at the age of nine, when he saw a small and middle-aged man defeat a huge guy in an instant moment.
Since then, Oyama has had a special interest in "strength" and has studied various martial arts.
And one of them was karate, which he would spend his life training.
Oyama was meticulous and sincere and had the patience to practice for hours and hours by himself.
                A lifetime together after encountering Karate and Chiyako.
     生涯を共に歩む「空手」と「智弥子」との出会い。  生涯を共に歩む「空手」と「智弥子」との出会い。        妻・智弥子と出会ったのは戦後間もなくである。大山は智弥子に惚れ込み、自宅に通い情熱的なアプローチをし、ついにはその心を射止めた。 二人はまるで聖句の言葉の様に富める時も貧しい時も暮らした。雨漏りする家では大山は己の不甲斐なさを罰するかの様に敢えてその身を濡らしながら読書し、智弥子はそんな夫に傘を差す。 大山倍達は一人で強くなったのでは無い。智弥子の内助の功あって世界的な空手家は誕生したのである。大山倍達は山に篭もり下山後、京都で開催された大会にて優勝し、空手家として大成せんと一層稽古に励んだ。  It was shortly after the WW2, the scenery that were left was of a national despair and burnt fields of Tokyo, that he met his wife, Chiyako.
In the moment, Oyama fell in love with her and made passionate approach to her, making daily visits to her home and eventually winning her heart.
Their life together was rough from the beginning.
Like the words of the wedding vows, "for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health" she was stood by side of Oyama until his last breath.
When they were poor and living in a wood shack Oyama used to study and read while rain leaked from the rooftop, Chiyako quietly held an umbrella over her husband and his books.
In later years Oyama would frequently note to others that he did not become strong on his own.
He always thanked Chiyako for her endless support to him and his passion hence the world-famous karate master and the creation of Kyokushin Karate was born.
Mas Oyama hid himself in the mountains and trained karate.
After coming down from the mountains, he won a karate tournament held in Kyoto and trained even harder to become a great karate master.
        The “God Hand” that shook the world.
And then, To the fight with 47 southern oxen.
     世界を震撼させたGOD HAND。そして、四十七頭の南部牛との激闘へ  世界を震撼させたGOD HAND。そして、四十七頭の南部牛との激闘へ        1952年、大山はプロレスラー・グレート東郷の招聘により柔道家の遠藤幸吉と共に渡米、東郷の兄弟として”Mas Togo”となり中西部から大西洋南部辺りを中心に巡業し空手の偉力をアメリカ人に披露した。板を割り石を砕き、時にはプロレスラーや飛び入りの観客を相手に強さを見せ付けたのだ。稲妻の如き素早さで繰り広げられる神技に驚嘆し、魔術の様であると賞賛し、やがて”GOD HAND”と称される事になる。 1954年、大山は千葉県館山市の海岸で記録映画の撮影の為、400kgを超える南部牛の角折りに挑戦。半年前から47頭とも言われる数の牛の角折りに成功していたものの、この大きさの牛は初めてで、かなり緊張してたという。しかし激戦の末その神の手の一撃で角を折り、ついにはその角をもぎ取った。現在では批判もされる向きもあるだろうが、紛れもなく大山の空手の精華であろう  In 1952, Oyama was invited by a famous a “Ni Sei” a second generation Japanese / American wrestler named “Great Togo” to the United States with another fellow Japanese judo fighter Kokichi Endo.
The three formed a unit and adopted their wrestling alias - “The Togo's Brothers”.
As Oyama became “Mas Togo", he toured with other “Togo Brothers” and participated in the wrestling matches around the Midwest and South Atlantic to show Americans the power of Karate.
He showed his strength by breaking wooden boards, crushing stones, and sometimes inviting challengers such as wrestlers and huge guys from spectators.
People marveled at his lightning quick moves (some people named him "Thunderbolt Togo"), praised them as magical, and eventually called him the “God Hand” or “Hand of God.” In 1954, Oyama challenged himself to break the horns of a Japanese bull with his bare hands, each bulls weighed over 900 lbs and filmed for a documentary at the beach in Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture.
Oyama had successfully broke the horns of 47 bulls in the previous six months of the training period, the bull that was chosen for the film was a size of another level.
It was his first time to fight a bull of that size, he was very nervous.
After a fierce battle, he broke the horns with a shuto (knife-hand strike) blow and finally ripped them off.
Although he may be criticized today, he was undoubtedly the result of his dedicated training of “Oyama Karate”.

                    An insatiable quest for strength.
The strength that went beyond oceans, attracted Karate practitioners from all over the world.
    強さへの飽くなき探求心。その強さは海を越え、世界各国から空手修行者を集めた。  強さへの飽くなき探求心。その強さは海を越え、世界各国から空手修行者を集めた。        その後大山倍達は熊との対戦をも熱望し、研究の為子熊を飼い現地で生活する計画も立てていたが諸事情により断念。やがて大山個人の闘争の歴史を別の形で託す事となる。大山倍達は自分が強くなる事に労苦をいとわず、弟子を取る事にも否定的だった。時には智弥子に錐で尻を突かせ挙げられないバーベルを無理矢理挙げる、そんな孤独な探求者だった。 しかし大山の強さに憧れる少年は後を絶たず、やがて自宅に生徒が増えていった。その頃大山はアメリカでの経験から、海外に向けて空手の技術書を出したいと考えていた。招待に応じて海外指導に出掛けていたが、一人では限界があったのだ。 1957年、前年にバレエスタジオを改修した大山道場を池袋にオープンした大山は空手を多くの若者にも広めようと決断、自身の空手道場を極真会と名付ける。  After the bull fight Oyama wanted to fight Hokkaido grizzly bear.
He had planned to keep a bear cub and live in the area for research of bear's living.
He was forced to give up the fight due to protests from both the prefecture and the environmentalist in the area.
However Oyama's personal fighting history took a drastic shift in another form.
Mas Oyama dedicated his life to Budo Karate.
Focused on becoming the strongest in the world he was reluctant to take any disciples.
He was a fervorous seeker, sometimes asking Chiyako to stab him in the buttocks with an ice pick to lift a heavy barbell he otherwise could not lift.
However, there was the number of neighborhood boys who admired Oyama's strength, and soon he had a growing number of students at home.
At that time, Oyama wanted to publish a book on karate overseas based on his experience in the US.
He also received numerous invitations to teach karate overseas, but there was a limit to what he could do on his own.
In 1957, Oyama opened The Oyama Dojo (training hall) in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, which he had renovated from a ballet studio the previous year.
Oyama decided to teach karate to many young people as well and named his karate dojo "Kyokushin-kai (society of ultimate truth)".
        Holding the world's All-Japan Karate Tournament with “full-contact karate rule”, he built up the ultimate form of Karate in his lifetime.”      直接打撃制による空手世界大会の実施。空手の究極の形を、一代で築きあげた。  直接打撃制による空手世界大会の実施。空手の究極の形を、一代で築きあげた。        1958年には海外空手ブームの先鞭となる初の英文による空手の技術書”What is karate?”を出版、そして1965年には世界的なベストセラーとなる”This is karate”を出版した。これにより多くの外国人空手修行者が東京本部を訪れ、更に空手を世界に広める事になる。 1969年、従来の当てない空手ルールに不満のあった大山は素手による直接打撃制を提唱、「殺人空手大会」と揶揄された新ルールによる大会はやがて一つの潮流を生み出し、一大勢力となる。 1991年、大山の開いた世界大会は100を超える国から200名以上もの選手が集結し激戦を繰り広げた。これは国家に属さない単一組織による世界大会としては世界最大規模では無かろうか。大山は一代で事を成したのである。かつて夢を見た、大きな事を成す男になったのだ。 1994年、大山倍達はこの世を去った。多くの門下生が嘆き悲しみその遺志を受け継ぐと誓った。最後まで闘い続けた大山の功績は世界130カ国、累計1200万人とされる門下生に代表されるであろう。そして今尚、強さに憧れる者たちは大山が創始した極真空手を学び、極真の道を全うしている。  In 1958, Oyama published his first technical book "What is karate?", the first karate book in English.
As a result, it blazed overseas triggering an instant karate boom.
In 1965, he published a sequel and another international best-seller, “This is karate", which attracted many foreign karate practitioners to the Tokyo Headquarters and further spread karate to the world.
In 1969, Oyama, who was dissatisfied with the traditional non-contact karate rule, advocated a system of direct strikes with bare knuckles, which he named it “full-contact karate rule” and the tournament with the new rules.
Some magazines ridiculed as a "deadly karate tournament", eventually created a trend and became a major force.
In 1991, more than 200 fighters from over 100 countries gathered at Oyama's world tournament and fought fiercely.
This was probably the world's largest tournament by a single organization which not affiliated with a nation.
Oyama had accomplished a great deal in his lifetime.
Now he became the man who accomplished the great things he once dreamed of.
In 1994, Mas Oyama was passed away.
Many of his students were saddened by his passing and all individually vowed to carry on his legacy.
The achievements of Oyama, who continued to fight until the end of his life, are represented by his 12 million students in 130 countries.
He did not appoint successor for the organization he built.
And even today, those who admire his strength and philosophy are studying Kyokushin Karate, and fulfilling the path of Kyokushin which he founded.

                         How to Create a Contact Form on Your Site (+ 7 Free Templates)    Get HubSpot's WordPress Plugin        Kristen Baker          Published: August 31, 2022       Customers want to connect — according to data from  Sprout Social , 64% of consumers want brands to connect with them and build better relationships.
 The result?
More than half of customers will increase their spending and three-quarters will increase their loyalty.
  What does this mean for your business?
That it’s critical to create multiple pathways for consumer connection.
While new solutions such as chat bots provide instant response and traditional channels like email keep customers at a distance, there’s critical middle ground: Contact forms.
 Here’s what you need to know about why contact forms matter, how to create forms (and pages) that make it easy for customers to connect, and the best ways to build out your contact forms for maximum impact.
 Let’s get started by talking about why contact forms are so important.
 Benefits of Contact Forms   Brands don’t exist in isolation.
In a mobile-first, social-driven world, businesses are part of a larger societal narrative that speaks to the need for connection at scale and on-demand.
 Companies capable of demonstrating relatability, humor and self-reflection in online customer interactions stand out from the crowd — and often forge connections that help drive long-term ROI.
 Social media represents the fast-moving forefront of this connective current; sites like Facebook and Twitter empower real-time responses to consumer questions.
Email inquires take longer and are less certain — customers are often unsure if corporate addresses listed on brand sites are there for general inquiries or specific questions.

 So, let's start by reviewing how to create a contact form.
We're doing to cover the steps to do this within HubSpot — whatever software or tool you use, the steps should be somewhat similar.
   How to Create a Contact Form    Log into your HubSpot account or create a free account.
 Click on “Marketing” and then “Forms” in the drop-down menu.
 Open the “Forms” landing page and click “Create a free form.
 Select your preferred form type.
 Choose the “Contact us” form template and then “Start”.
 Pick the contact elements you want to incorporate.
 Click “Publish”.
     Contact forms aren’t complicated — and they’re not meant to be.The goal of any contact form is to quickly collect customer information, identify key concerns and ensure this information gets to the right person in your organization.
In many cases, contact forms are linked with automatic emails to ensure customers and staff receive confirmation of submission.
 While there’s no single way to create a contact form, here’s a step-by-step guide to building a form with HubSpot's Forms Tool .
 1.
Log into your HubSpot account or create a free account.
  To begin, log into your HubSpot account or create a free account if you don’t have one.
 2.
Click on "Marketing" and then "Forms" in the drop-down menu.
  Next, head to "Marketing" and then, in the drop-down menu, click "Forms".
 3.
Open the "Forms" landing page and click "Create a free form".
 Now, open the landing page for "Forms" to "Create a free form" — this is how you'll be able to customize your contact form.
 4.
Select your preferred form type.
  Choose the type of form you want to create.
In this example, we’ll use the the embedded form.
Then, click “next” and you’ll see this page.
 5.
Choose the "Contact us" form template and then "Start".
  Click on the "Contact us" form template to "Start" the form customization process.
 6.
Pick the contact elements you want to incorporate.
  Next, choose the contact form elements you want to incorporate.
You'll notice the form comes prebuilt with "Email", "First name", "Last name", and "Message" fields.
 You can add other elements like "Address", "Phone Number", and even GDPR-related options as needed.
You can also activate automatic ticketing or Captcha.
   8.
Click "Publish".
  And that's it! Click "Publish" and you're good to go.
From here, you’ll be able to both share form links or copy and embed code directly into your website.
 While embedded forms make it easy for visitors to quickly reach out and get in touch, they can also get overwhelmed by other elements on your site.
Let’s dig into another contact option: The standalone page .

 Access now     Learn more              How to Create a Contact Page    Log into your HubSpot account and select “Standalone page”.
 Select multiple contact properties and/or create new fields.
 Click “Follow-up” and then “Create follow up email”.
 Choose “Options” at the top of the screen.
 Choose the “Contact us” form template and then “Start”.
 Click “Style & Preview” at the top of the page.
 “Publish” to get your sharable link and embeddable code.
      For the sake of consistency, we'll review the steps in creating a contact page in HubSpot in this section as well.
 1.
Log into your HubSpot account and select "Standalone page".
  Start by logging into your HubSpot account.
Click on “Marketing” and then “Forms”.
Then select “Standalone page”.
 2.
Select multiple contact properties and/or create new fields.
  Now select the multiple contact properties you want and/or create new fields for your form.
 3.
Click “Follow-up” and then “Create follow up email”.
  At the top of the screen, click “Follow-up” to land on the “Create follow up email” page.
 Once here, you can create and save an email template that’s automatically sent to users after they submit your contact form.
 This is a great way to make sure you acknowledge receipt of the contact form and give customers an idea of your typical response time.
 4.
Choose “Options” at the top of the screen.
   By choosing "Options" at the top of the screen, you can determine what happens after users submit your contact form — you have the option to display a "thank you" message or redirect them to another page.
 You can also direct submissions to a specific email address and add links to reset the form after completion.
  5.
Click “Style & Preview” at the top of the page.
   When you click "Style & Preview", you can decide on the style of your input fields — default boxes, linear, round or sharp — in addition to your fonts and colors.
 There's also an option to preview what your form will look like on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones prior to officially sending it out.
  7.
“Publish” to get your sharable link and embeddable code.
  Hit "Publish" to get your shareable link and embedded code, and you're done!  Now let's review some popular free contact form templates to help you through the processes we just covered.

       How to Create a Static Website Using WordPress in 2023    Get HubSpot's WordPress Plugin        Anna Fitzgerald     Updated: June 14, 2022   Published: April 28, 2022       WordPress is used by over 30 million active websites, according to data from BuiltWith .
Many of those websites are dynamic, but a growing number are static — and for good reason.
Static websites can be faster, more secure, and easier to scale than dynamic sites.
  In this post, we’ll take a closer look at what static websites have come to mean in 2023 and some examples .
Then we'll cover how to create a static homepage using WordPress and what static hosting providers , plugins , and themes can help you when creating a static website.
   What is a static website?
 A static website is made up of HTML files that represent different web pages.
When a visitor lands on the site, their browser makes a request to the server, which returns a single HTML file (and likely some accompanying style sheets and scripts) to display the requested page in the browser.
This page is rendered the same for every visitor, and can only be changed if a programmer manually modifies the HTML file.
 Static vs.
Dynamic Websites  "Today, static websites can be very 'dynamic' in terms of the experience they offer to visitors," explains Strattic CEO Miriam Schwab.
"This is thanks to advances in frontend technologies like CSS and Javascript, which enable web developers to give users a richer, more interactive experience, even on sites that are technically 'static.'"  Dynamic websites, i.e. sites that are running on servers that are constantly processing information and generating the web pages, have the ability to generate pages that are more customized to a user's real-time needs.
That’s because dynamic websites don’t store each page as its own HTML file, which is then retrieved and displayed as is by the server.
Instead, servers build the pages of a dynamic website on-the-fly using HTML, CSS, and server-side scripting languages like PHP.
Meaning, a visitor requests a page and the server pulls information from one or multiple databases to construct the HTML file for that unique website visitor.
 Since this is resource- and time-intensive, dynamic websites can have slow load times and other performance issues.
Static websites, on the other hand, are typically much faster, even as traffic scales, and like mentioned above, can be just as dynamic as "dynamic" websites these days.
Let's take a look at some examples below.
 To learn more about the differences, check out our definitive guide to static vs dynamic websites .
  Examples of Static Websites  Below are examples of static websites hosted by Strattic , a hosting platform that converts WordPress to a static architecture in order to optimize its performance and security.
 1.
Workiz   Workiz is an all-in-one scheduling software and app designed for home-services professionals.
In order to scale their business and keep it secure, Workiz uses WordPress solely for content management and deploys it as a static replica.
This static replica is served up via a global CDN so it’s fast and high-performing despite its sophistication and frequent content updates.
   2.
Rookout   Rookout is designed to provide companies with the debug and monitoring data they need from running applications to help them solve customer issues faster.
In order to ensure performance and scalability, Rookout has a static site in order to improve security, reduce server load, and increase the speed of its site.
 3.
Payoneer   Payoneer is a platform for businesses to make international payments, receive funds, access capital, and more.
To avoid downtime, even during spikes in traffic, Payoneer has a static WordPress site.
Each page is a static file that gets distributed fully via a CDN so the site actually loads faster as traffic increases.
     How to Create a Static Homepage in WordPress    Log into your WordPress dashboard.
 Go to Pages > Add New.
 Add a title to your new page and any content to welcome your visitors.
 Click the blue Publish button.
 Go to Settings > Reading.
 Under Your homepage displays, click A static page.
Then, next to Homepage, select the new page you created.
 Click Save Changes.
      By default, WordPress displays a list of posts on your homepage.
This list is automatically updated when new posts are published.
If you'd prefer not to display your latest posts,  you’ll need to create a static page and then set it as your homepage.
 Despite the confusing name, this functionality actually has nothing to do with static websites as described above.
Instead, it allows users to configure a front page, or homepage, for their website that is not a blog.
We know the naming is confusing, but it’s a historical feature that isn’t likely to change any time soon.
 In order to create a static homepage on your WordPress site, follow the steps below or check out this video:     1.
Log into your WordPress dashboard.
2.
Go to Pages > Add New .
3.
Add a title to your new page and any content to welcome your visitors.
(You also can select a full-width template to improve the layout of your homepage.)   4.
Click the blue Publish button.
5.
Go to Settings > Reading .
6.
Under Your homepage displays , click A static page .
Then, next to Homepage , select the new page you created.
  7.
Click Save Changes .
 Here’s how your homepage might look:    Now back to static websites.
 WordPress Static Hosting  To create a static WordPress site, you can use a static WordPress hosting provider that converts your site to a static architecture instantly.
Here are some of the most popular platforms.
 1.
Strattic   Strattic is an all-in-one static site generation and hosting platform.
It creates a static version of your WordPress site that's delivered via a CDN and detaches the front-end of your website from your WordPress admin dashboard.
That means content marketers can continue to create and manage content in WordPress while your developers can benefit from the flexibility, scalability, and enhanced performance of a headless site.
 2.

  WordPress Plugins for Your Static Website  One disadvantage of having a static website is that some types of functionality won’t work out of the box, so you need to make it static-compatible.
That means some features, like your search functionality, may need to be replaced.
Some plugins will need to be supported out of the box as well.
Fortunately, there are some plugins that work with many static generated WordPress sites (and all work with Strattic).
Below are some examples.

A Beginner's Guide   Apr 01, 2024                          Download   Simply Static  By Patrick Posner          Details  Reviews   Installation   Development    Support       Description  Simply Static is a static site generator that converts your existing WordPress website to a static website that you can host on your server, a static hosting provider, or a CDN.
 It drastically improves the performance of your website and minimizes security risks as it removes the connection between your traditional server and your static website.
 Simply Static can also be used by local development tools like LocalWP or Lando to develop your website offline and push the static site online.
 This reduces your hosting costs to zero (depending on your requirements and the used service/provider).
 Performance  Converting your website to a static website can drastically improve your performance.
Simply Static eliminates all requests to your database and by that reducing the first time to byte.
 This is especially impactful for websites that use long pages with a lot of animations, graphs, and other load-heavy tools like sliders.
 Security  Removing the connection to your database and traditional server reduces the risk of getting hacked.
 This reduces the stress to keep your WordPress website up to date and keeps your data secure (locally or in a protected environment).
 Reduce hosting costs  Using Simply Static to deploy your website to one of the static hosting providers, a CDN or an S3 bucket reduces the amount of money required for reliable web hosting.
 With the right setup, you can even host your website completely for free (Cloudflare Pages and GitHub Pages for example).
 Local development  Develop your site locally and only push the static exported website on a server.
To ensure everything works as expected I created a list of development tools that are completely supported:   LocalWP  lando   I highly recommend not to use another tool for local development if you are not a programmer as in most cases manual package installation is required.
 Simply Static Pro  The pro version of Simply Static enhances the plugin with various features.
  GitHub Integration  With the GitHub integration, you can completely automate your entire development process.
 The only thing you need is a GitHub account, no knowledge of Git or GitHub itself is required, as Simply Static Pro handles the entire process for you and keeps your repository up to date.
 This allows deploying your static website to:   GitHub Pages  Cloudflare Pages  Netlify  Vercel  SFTP to your server   AWS S3 Integration  Export directly to Amazon AWS S3 from Simply Static Pro.
Connect your bucket and run your export.
 BunnyCDN Integration  Export directly to BunnyCDN and get all the benefits of their CDN – including caching, file optimization and DNS management.
 Builds and Single Exports  Create builds to export only a subset of pages/posts.
You can assign a build to every custom post type in your WordPress admin area and export them.
 Never sit back and watch a full static export running, instead run a complete export once and then use builds to export the changes as fast as possible.
 You can also export single pages/posts after changed something.
 Forms  Simply Static Pro supports Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms to use on your static website.
 You can decide if you want to use an external service like Zapier and IFTTT or if your original WordPress website should handle the submission and send you an e-mail with all the details.
 Search  Use a fully static search solution that does not rely on any Third-Party-Providers.
It uses Fuse.js and creates an index of your whole website as a JSON file.
 The search supports autosuggestion and fuzzy logic and is by default way more convenient than your default WordPress search.
 Comments  Enable comments on your static website without the requirement of Third-Party-Providers.
Use your original WordPress website to process the comment.
 After a comment was submitted, Simply Static automatically exports a new static version of the post.
You don’t have to do anything.
 Multilingual  Use WPML, Polylang or TranslatePress and run static exports per language or all at once.
 Simply Static Pro also supports configuring settings per language, using the available language switchers and more to export a your multilingual website as easy as possible.
 WP-CLI  Simply Static Pro has a detailed and comprehensive integration with WP-CLI.
 Control every option, run different kinds of exports and more with the WP-CLI integration.
 Minification  Automatically minfiy HTML, CSS and JavaScript files on your static site.
 We can even minify inline CSS & JavaScript.
 Optimization  Replace default WordPress paths and completely hide that you are using WordPress behind the scenes.
 Replace:   wp-content  wp-includes  wp-content/plugins/  wp-content/themes/  wp-content/uploads/   Hide & Disable:  Disabled unwanted features in WordPress before running an static export like:   XML-RPC  REST API URLs  Emoji support  Shortlink support  WordPress version in HTML   and much more.
 Get the Pro version  You can get the pro version here .
 Tutorials  I publish new tutorials on how to work with Simply Static and other tools on my blog.
 You can check the current tutorials here   Screenshots  Generate Settings Diagnostics   Installation   Log into your WordPress website.
 On the left menu, hover over Plugins and then click on Add New.
 In the Search Plugins box, type in “Simply Static” and press the Enter key.
 You will see a list of search results that should include the Simply Static plugin.
Click on the Install Now button to install the plugin.
 After installing the plugin you will be prompted to activate it.
Click on the Activate Plugin link.
 The Simply Static plugin is now installed and can be found on the left menu.
  or   Upload the entire simply-static folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
 Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
   FAQ    What does Simply Static do?
   Simply Static generates static (HTML) copies of your WordPress pages.
It works a bit like a web crawler, starting at the main page of your website and looking for links to other pages to create static copies of.
It also includes any images, CSS & JS files, and any other files that it can find a link to.
 As Simply Static is creating the static pages, it will automatically replace the URLs for the WordPress installation with either (a) absolute URLs, at a domain of your choice or (b) relative URLs, so you can host the static files on any domain or (c) URLs constructed for offline use, so you can browse the site locally on your computer.
   Who should use Simply Static?
   Pretty much everyone, besides e-commerce or membership sites.
They require a serious amount of interaction and user accounts, which are not available on a static website.
   Are there any limitations?
   You can not use plugins that require a login as there is no account system on a static website.
This applies to e-commerce (like WooCommerce) or membership sites.
 Also, a website that relies heavily on ajax to update content in real-time is not the best project for Simply Static as a serious amount of custom development would be required.
   How do I set up Simply Static?
   Let’s assume you presently have WordPress hosting a site at www.example.com, and that’s where you’d like to have your static site instead.
Your first task is going to be to move your WordPress installation to a subdomain, such as wordpress.example.com.
Once that is complete, you’ll set up www.example.com to receive your static files.
 If www.example.com is on the same server as your WordPress installation, you can have Simply Static copy the static files to the directory that www.example.com is serving files from.
If www.example.com is on a different server, you can download a zip of your static files and then upload them to www.example.com.
   Will this plugin interfere with other plugins?
   No, Simply Static will not interfere with other plugins.
Simply Static works well alongside other plugins, such as plugins to improve your site’s SEO.
 Simply Static creates a static copy of your website, which is just a collection of files: HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.
Any functionality that requires PHP code will not work with that static copy.
That includes, but is not limited to: blog post comments, contact forms, forums, membership areas, and eCommerce.
 Note that you can achieve much of this functionality by using plugins that interact with third-party services or Simply Static Pro.
   How is Simply Static different from cache plugins?
   Cache plugins — such as W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache — make your existing WordPress site faster by caching pages as they’re visited.
This makes your site much faster but still leaves your WordPress installation accessible to the outside world.
Unless you keep on top of updates, your WordPress installation can become vulnerable to hackers due to security vulnerabilities that are found over time.
 Simply Static creates a static copy of your WordPress site that is intended to be used completely separately from your WordPress installation.
Your WordPress installation lives on one server and your static site is served on a different server.
Or, they’re both on the same server, but your WordPress installation is restricted to only allow access from certain IP addresses or with an additional username/password requirement.
Your static site is just a collection of static files with no server-side code or database — nothing for hackers to hack — while your WordPress installation remains safe and secure.
    Reviews          It’s a Work in Progress    Mustafa  April 17, 2024    I am a big advocate of headless / decoupled / static front end so for that reason I really want this plugin to succeed.



I purchased Pro LTD of this plugin 2 times and returned / refunded both the times because as of now it still has bugs and minimum support.
But I am sure it will get there and will be quite a useful plugin.



The FREE Version works great to export static files of your WP however following are the few bugs / shortcomings I noticed.



1 - It doesn't export all images (wp-content properly) for example if your WP creates resized images (thumbnail, etc etc) those do not get exported.
as a result, these images will not display in respective devices (such as mobile etc).
A work-around for this is that you can copy your wp-content/uploads manually from your wp install into your static zip and upload that zip so all content is there.



2 - The folder structure that gets exported isn't quite clean.
Sometimes you'll see multiple folders for one single post / page each having an index.
Are these post revisions by any chance?
I am not quite sure.



Nothing else major.
So for a free version (except above 2 points) it's quite a good solution.
The first one (content not getting pushed) is a bit of a weird one, i hope there's a easier workaround or fix for that.
          5 stars for plugin and support    dutuka  April 4, 2024    Very usefull plugin!           Game changer    allenfuller  March 29, 2024    I'm really blown away by Patrick's plugin.
He is constantly shipping new updates that make it more robust.
We have saved a lot of money (and headache) by using Wordpress as a staging site, then pushing updates to a live, static site.
          I’ll be your Most Valuable Plugin !!    guilleta  February 26, 2024    You ditch Cookie worries, server configurations (costs & all), size, improve speed, security and feel in control from a local WP installation.
Support is fast & solid.




SSpro + Bunny.net CDN = Peace of mind.
Thank you!           Great!    erikmelkersson  January 25, 2024    Tested both offline usage and dump for online usage and also both a site in a mulitisite and a standalone site.
Works great.
Thank you!           Really easy to make a html copy    3littlepenguins  January 18, 2024    Great plugin for making a html copy of the site!     Read all 167 reviews   Contributors & Developers  “Simply Static” is open source software.

 Download for Free          Updated: 03/01/24   Published: 03/01/24        When you‘re just getting started with making a website, I know that the process of learning how to use WordPress can feel overwhelming.
We’ve all been there, so you're certainly not alone.
  While WordPress does have a bit of a learning curve, I still think it‘s something that anyone can use to build a website — even people who have never done so before.
That’s why WordPress is, by far, the mo st popular way to make a website .
 To make the process as painless as possible, all you need is the right knowledge, which is what we‘ve created this post for.
Below, I’ll take you step-by-step through how to use WordPress to build your very own website .
      What is WordPress?
  WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that allows you to host and build websites.
WordPress contains plugin architecture and a template system, so you can customize any website to fit your business, blog, portfolio, or online store.
     I‘ll cover everything that you need to build your own WordPress site, starting from zero and working up to adding your own content and plugins.
Beyond the step-by-step guide, I’ll also share a list of tips and tricks to remember while working with WordPress.
 But first, let’s answer the question most people have when they begin thinking about their new WordPress website: What is the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com?
  WordPress.org vs.
WordPress.com  The difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com has to do with who is actually hosting your website.
 When you use the WordPress.org  software  (AKA “self-hosted WordPress”), you host your own website or blog using a third-party hosting provider.
You'll need to purchase web hosting and a domain name, install the WordPress software on your hosting, and then manage your site going forward.
While most web hosting services give you a lot of tools to make this easier, it’s still a more hands-on experience than WordPress.com.
 WordPress.com offers to host your website for you, more like a software-as-a-service tool (SaaS).
You also don’t need to download any software or manage a server.
You can either use a WordPress.com subdomain for free (e.g. yoursite.wordpress.com ), or you can pay to use your own custom domain name ( e.g., yoursite.com ), which I think is a better approach for most websites.
 How to Choose Between WordPress.org or WordPress.com  You may be wondering whether WordPress.org or WordPress.com would be a better fit.
Let’s review a few more of the pros and cons that come with both options, so you can make an informed decision.
 WordPress.org is ideal if you want full power over customizing and controlling your website.
However, there is more responsibility that comes with managing a WordPress.org website.
You have to purchase and set up your own domain name, upload and install plugins and a theme, update your website’s software, and maintain your website’s security.
WordPress.org is free to use, but you have to pay for everything else that goes into having a website.
 I think that WordPress.org is still definitely something that a non-technical user can handle, but it's still not as easy as WordPress.com.
 WordPress.com is preferable if you’re looking for an all-in-one option that has most of the hard work done for you.
You’ll never need to manage your server, pay for your hosting, or buy a domain.
There are also a number of customization options that come with a WordPress.com plan to help you make your website look the way you want it to.
 WordPress.com has a free and paid version.
If you stick with the free version, you can’t upload any custom themes or plugins, and you will have a WordPress subdomain.
I think this makes the free plan unsuitable for most serious websites.
 If you want to use your own custom domain name and install your own WordPress themes and plugins, you'll need to pay for at least the WordPress.com Creator plan, which costs $40 per month (or $25 per month if you pay annually).
  WordPress for Beginners: How to Use WordPress  There are a number of ways for you to create your dream website with WordPress.
Users generally find the software easy to use , but I know that getting started can be understandably intimidating if you’re completely new to the process.
That’s why we have built this “WordPress for Beginners” guide.
Want a quick introduction before you dive deep?
Check out this helpful video:                                           For even more resources, I've also compiled some of the best websites for learning about WordPress — these can be incredibly valuable sources of information as you start your journey.
     How to Build a WordPress Website    Select a WordPress plan (WordPress.com only).

 Install WordPress.
 Choose your theme.
 Add posts and pages to your website.
 Customize your website.

Select a WordPress plan (WordPress.com only).
 To start, you‘ll need to choose whether you’re using WordPress.org (AKA self-hosted WordPress) or WordPress.com.
 If you want to use WordPress.org, you can skip ahead to the next step.
 If you want to use WordPress.com, you’ll have to choose between the  five preset plans that WordPress.com offers.
  Image Source  Again, I think that most people who are looking to make a serious website should choose at least the Creator plan.
You'll need this plan to install your own custom themes and plugins, which are some of the best parts of WordPress.
 However, if you don‘t think you’ll need any custom themes or plugins, I think the Starter plan is also fine, as it lets you use your own custom domain name and removes the WordPress.com ads.
 2.
Set up your domain name and hosting provider (WordPress.org).
 If you‘d rather use WordPress.org than WordPress.com, you’ll need to choose your hosting provider and set up your domain name before you can start building your WordPress website.
 Before we talk about how to complete those tasks, I think that it's important to discuss the difference between your domain name and hosting provider.
 Think about your domain name as your website's home address — it’s how your visitors are able to locate your website on the Internet.
Your domain name will look something like this: www.example.com.
For example, our domain name is hubspot.com.
 Your hosting provider is like your house — it's where your website files are actually stored.
Without a hosting provider, your site wouldn’t have space on a server to “live.” Some of the best WordPress hosting providers include WP Engine ,  Bluehost , Rocket.net , and Kinsta .
  Image Source  How to Pick Domain and Hosting Providers  Again, WordPress.org requires you to purchase your own domain and find a third-party hosting provider for your website.
WordPress.com allows you to decide whether or not you want a custom domain depending on the plan you choose, but it takes care of the hosting for you.
 Your hosting provider is important because it impacts your website’s speed, security, and reliability.
There are hundreds of providers to choose from, which is why we put together a list of the best WordPress hosting providers to help you decide what will work best for you.
All of these providers meet WordPress’s three basic hosting requirements :   PHP version 7.4 or greater  MySQL version 5.7 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.4 or greater.
 HTTPS support   When considering hosting providers for your WordPress site, make sure they meet all of the above criteria.
 For domain names, getting one is as easy as searching and purchasing one through your domain registrar of choice.
Many web hosts also offer their own domain registration services, and some will even give you a free domain name for the first year.
 If you are new to WordPress but have already purchased and created a domain name elsewhere, no problem — you’ll have the option to transfer or map it to your WordPress website.
 For the sake of this guide, let’s assume you do not yet have a domain or hosting provider.
Here’s how to start creating your website with the popular hosting service Bluehost.
 First, head to Bluehost’s WordPress hosting page and click View Plans .
  Image Source  From here, you’ll be taken to Bluehost’s pricing page to choose from four plans.
  Image Source  I recommend using the Choice Plus plan if it fits your budget, but the Basic plan is fine if you want to keep costs as low as possible.
 Once you choose your plan and click Select , you’ll be taken to another page to sign up with a domain name (which is free for the first year).
  Image Source  Once you select your domain name, you’ll be brought to a page to complete your account and billing information for your purchase.
  Image Source  I don‘t think most people need any of the Package Extras, so feel free to disable them.
For example, Bluehost already offers free SSL certificates via Let’s Encrypt, so there's no need to purchase the Single Domain SSL add-on.
 After confirming your account and purchasing your domain, you will gain access to your hosting dashboard, where you’ll be able to install the WordPress CMS.
 3.
Install WordPress.
 If you are using your own WordPress hosting provider (instead of WordPress.com), you’ll need to install the WordPress software to connect your new domain to your website.
 To make this as easy as possible, most web hosts offer simple one-click WordPress installer tools.
I think it's also worth noting that some WordPress hosting services will pre-install WordPress for you as part of the hosting account setup process.
 For this example, let's continue using Bluehost.
However, I think the same general principles that you see here will apply to pretty much any WordPress host.
 To start, log in to your Bluehost account, select Hosting on the left side, and click Add Site .
  Image Source  On the next screen, choose the option to Install WordPress .
  Image Source  You can then give your site a title and choose which domain you want to connect to this site ( you should already see your domain name if you chose a free domain name when signing up for Bluehost ).
  Image Source  After you click Continue , there will be a short wait while Bluehost installs WordPress for you.
 Once the installation process finishes, you'll see an option to Log Into WordPress , which will take you to your WordPress dashboard.
  Image Source  As I mentioned above, the process will look slightly different if you're using another WordPress host, but the basic steps will be the same.
 For example, here's what the WordPress installer looks like at Rocket.net, a dedicated WordPress host:   Now, on to step four: making your website look nice.
 4.
Choose your theme.
 You can customize your WordPress website's design using WordPress’s many themes and templates , each of which contains a multitude of layouts, formatting styles, colors, fonts, and other visual options.
 When you first install the WordPress software, WordPress automatically applies a default theme that looks rather plain.
Instead of using that default theme, I recommend installing a new WordPress theme that matches your preferred design aesthetic.
 You can find thousands of free or paid themes, so you're almost certain to find a design that you like.
 We have a post on our favorite WordPress themes and a guide on how to choose your WordPress theme .
For most people, though, I think that choosing a lightweight multipurpose theme like Astra , Kadence Theme , or GeneratePress is a great place to start.
 All of these themes are multipurpose ( which means you can use them for any type of site ) and include dozens or hundreds of importable “starter sites.” This basically means that you can import a starter site design with just a few clicks and then instantly have a beautiful website.
 To find a theme that works best for you in WordPress.org, head to your WordPress admin dashboard.
Click Appearance , then Themes .
Then, click the Add New Theme button at the top.
 You'll be brought to another screen where you can browse available themes or search for a specific one you have in mind.
  Image Source  IMG: theme  Once you find the perfect theme, you can install it to begin customizing.
Each theme has different steps required during the customization process, so be sure to follow them closely.
 Generally, you can customize most WordPress themes by going to Appearance , then Customize .
 If you choose one of the newer “Full-Site Editing” themes , you can customize it by going to Appearance , then Editor.
 For more details, we have a whole post on how to customize a WordPress theme .
You can also consult your theme developer's documentation for instructions that are specific to your chosen theme.

Add posts and pages to your website.
 When you add content to your WordPress website, it’s usually displayed in the form of posts and pages:   Posts — Use these when you want to create blog posts or other similar content.
New posts will automatically appear at the top of your blog listing page, and each post will have its own public publish date.
 Pages — These are better for static content that doesn't have a publish date.
For example, your “About” page , “Contact” page , and so on.
There‘s no default page that lists all of your "Pages," but you can add links to them using your site’s navigation menu or other areas.
  For more advanced use cases, you can also create your own WordPress custom post types .
However, I don't recommend going that route until you become more familiar with the WordPress software.
 To add a post to your website, go to the admin dashboard, click Posts , and then Add New Post .
  To add text, you can just click in the editor and start typing.
For other elements — e.g., images or buttons — you can add blocks to the editor .
 For more details, we have a whole guide on how to use the WordPress block editor .
 When you're finished, click Save Draft to save your changes as a draft, or click Publish to immediately take the post live.
 Adding a page to your website is a similar process.
In your admin area, click Pages , then Add New Page .
  You can then add content using the block editor and Publish it when you're finished.
 6.
Customize your website.
 Beyond the theme you choose, there are a number of ways to further customize your website.
I think that now is a good time to review a few options.
 First, you can customize your site title.
From your admin dashboard, select Settings > General .
Here, add your website title and tagline.
You can also toggle other basic site information like your URL, email, time zone, and more.
  Next, you can customize your reading sections.
Under Settings > Reading , you can change your homepage to a static page.
 By default, WordPress will display your latest blog posts on your site‘s homepage.
If your website isn’t a dedicated blog, you'll probably want to show a static homepage instead.
 You can create your homepage as we showed you above ( Pages → Add New Page ) and then assign it in this settings area.
  You can also customize your WordPress site's navigation menu , which can help your visitors to easily find information on your website.
 Add a navigation menu by going to your admin dashboard, clicking Appearance , and then Menus .
 If you‘re using a new "Full-Site Editing" theme, you’ll go to Appearance and then Editor instead.
However, most popular WordPress themes still use the Menus interface.
  From here, you can determine how you want your navigation menu to look, how many pages you want to include, what you want to title those pages, and what order you want them to be listed in.
 The exact design of your navigation menu will depend on your WordPress theme.
 Of course, this is just a fraction of what you can do in the dashboard — this post offers more information on your WordPress site settings and customization options.
 7.
Install plugins.
 WordPress p lugins are pieces of software that add functionality to your WordPress website and enhance the user experience.
You can use plugins for small features ( such as adding a contact form ) or big features ( such as turning your site into a fully functioning online store ).
 With over 59,000 free plugins in the WordPress.org directory ( and thousands more at other locations ), there are options for almost every type of website and user.
Some of the most popular plugins available include:   HubSpot WordPress Plugin .
Easily add pop-ups, forms, and live chat to your WordPress website.
And, as an added bonus, pair this plugin, or other CRM plugins, with your HubSpot CRM.
 All in One SEO .
A top-rated SEO plugin that’s used by businesses to improve their rankings and uncover new SEO growth opportunities.
 The Events Calendar .
An effortless events calendar that makes scheduling events from your site easy.
 Yoast SEO .
The go-to plugin to help you with on-page SEO.
This app makes sure you’re following best practices before you push your site live.
 TablePress .
Need a table on your site?
Look no further.
 The SEO Framework .
Another plugin that can help you master SEO on your site.
 Weglot .
A top translation plugin for translating WordPress and WooCommerce websites.
  To discover even more options, we have a whole post on the best WordPress plugins .
You can also search the HubSpot blog for lists of plugins for specific use cases, such as the best WordPress survey plugins .
 To install a new plugin, head to the Plugins section in your admin dashboard.
This shows you all the plugins currently installed on your site.
 Depending on your host, you might have several plugins installed already.
Note that for a plugin to work, you must activate it after installing.
  To add a new plugin, click the Add New Plugin button (or go to Plugins , then Add New Plugin ).
Search for your desired plugin and then click Install Now , wait a few seconds, then click Activate .
  For plugins that are not listed in the WordPress.org plugin directory, you can also upload a Zip file by clicking the Upload Plugin button at the top.
You'll typically use this approach if you purchase a premium plugin directly from the developer.
 Get the WordPress CRM plugin that helps you organize, track, and nurture your leads.
 8.
Optimize your website to increase page speed.
 Website performance is a critical part of the user experience.
If a page takes too long to load, your visitors will move quickly to another site.
You don't want to frustrate visitors with slow speeds.
 Choosing quality web hosting is one way to ensure that your site loads quickly.
Beyond that, you can implement essential WordPress performance best practices such as page caching , code optimization, image optimization , and so on.
 For an easy way to implement all of these important strategies, WP Rocket is a WordPress caching plugin that will make your site faster in a few clicks.
Thanks to powerful options such as Remove Unused CSS and Delay JS Execution, you’ll save time and effort while improving your Core Web Vitals grades, the PageSpeed Insights score, and the overall loading time.

Get inspired by WordPress website examples.
 As you begin to customize your website, you may feel overwhelmed by all the options you have.
Instead of starting completely from scratch, it helps to grab some inspiration from other exemplary WordPress websites.
 Here are some of our favorite WordPress website examples .
 99% Invisible is a popular podcast that focuses on design and architecture.
The 99% Invisible website is sleek and modern.
It offers easy navigation for visitors to quickly access each podcast episode.
  Image Source  The Houston Zoo's website displays its main attraction on the homepage.
The magnifying glass icon on the top menu bar makes searching the site effortless.
  Image Source  Awesome Motive , the creator behind several WordPress projects, engages visitors with a polished, yet simple, website.
It features subtle animation to grab people's attention.
   WordPress Website Tips and Tricks  There are a number of WordPress tips and tricks to make your website as impactful and user-friendly as possible — we’ve listed them below to help you do just that.
 1.
Use dashes and not underscores.
 When naming your files, use dashes and not underscores.
Google looks at underscores as joiners, meaning your file will look like one big word.
That won’t help you with your SEO.
Use dashes to make it obvious there are separate words.
 For example, use www.example.com/this-is-an-example, not www.example.com/this_is_an_example.
 2.
If you built your website with WordPress.com, use its online support.
 When building websites, you’ll probably have one or two questions — maybe more than that.
That’s where WordPress support comes in.
If you have any questions, check out their support documents.
You’ll find a number of forums and ways to reach out to WordPress experts listed on their website.
 3.
Back up and update your website regularly.
 Backups sound like extra work until you hit a technical roadblock and need a hard refresh.
If you ever lose access or have technological difficulties, you have everything you need to completely restore your content.
 There are a number of plugins, such as Snapshot Pro , made specifically for backing up your WordPress site.
Your WordPress host might also offer its own backup tool.
 Beyond that, you need to update your WordPress site and plugins regularly.
WordPress will tell you when updates are released.
This will keep your website looking fresh and working efficiently.
It's also important to protect your site from newly discovered security vulnerabilities.
 Updating your website is also an essential security best practice.
Updates keep your site secure to ensure no hackers can take advantage of system vulnerabilities.
Again, there are plenty of plugins , such as WP Defender , to help you with security.
 4.
Understand SEO.
 Learn and understand SEO basics to ensure your website is completely optimized so you can boost your conversions.
Research which keywords you want to rank for and use them throughout your copy.
You can even start a blog so you can share your knowledge while improving your ranking.
 Beyond that, make the most of multimedia.
Image alt text on photos can give you an extra boost .
Visuals and video content can also break up the text on your website pages.
 Create custom permalinks.
Permalinks are the permanent URLs that you plan to keep static for the foreseeable future.
They’re important because they improve user experience and enhance your WordPress website SEO.
We have a guide on choosing an optimized permalink structure .
 Keep an eye on your website’s performance and know what is and isn’t working for your visitors.
There are a number of useful WordPress plugins , as well as Google Analytics software, to help with this.
 5.
Create a custom homepage.
 As mentioned earlier, WordPress will provide you with a default homepage.
Take the time to create your own with a theme that works for your business — remember, this is your visitor’s first impression of your business, blog, or portfolio.
 Pro tip, you can feature social proof on your home page to show your new website visitors how many other people have already viewed your content.
There are plugins to help you do this in a matter of minutes.
 6.
Include an “About Us” page on your website.
 Your customers want to know  who you are.
That’s where your About Us page comes in.
Show your visitors that you’re a trustworthy person and/or business.
“About Us” pages are known to be one of the most-visited pages on websites (after homepages) — so introducing yourself is important.
Here are some “About Us” examples to inspire you.
 7.
Make the most of your blog posts.
 Include excerpts on your blog posts so people don’t land on your blog page and see your entire piece at once.
By only including excerpts on your blog page , you make room to list all of your blogs in one location.
Visitors can then read the excerpts and click through to read the posts they are most interested in.
 8.
Consider what your website looks like on mobile.
 It’s no secret that people are searching the Internet while on their phones, tablets, and other mobile devices these days.
All modern WordPress themes are “responsive,” which means they work on different devices.
However, I still recommend browsing your site on mobile to catch any issues or quirks.
 9.
Pick a CRM that works with your WordPress site.
 A CRM can help you keep track of the way users are interacting with your website and company.
You’ll have the opportunity to see what offers are garnering the most attention and becoming leads.
Here's a list of some of the best WordPress CRM options .
You can also get started with HubSpot , which has its own WordPress integrations .
  Build a Website With WordPress  Having a great website matters.
It’s how you connect with your visitors and leads, create a positive first impression with new users, and boost conversions.
The good news is creating your own website doesn’t have to be a daunting process…at least not with WordPress.
 The easy-to-use CMS offers completely customizable plans suitable for all needs.
With no prior knowledge necessary, you can start building your own site for your business, blog, portfolio, or online store immediately.

 Get Started          Updated: 09/04/23   Published: 09/04/23        If you're a beginner to the WordPress platform and aren't sure where to begin designing your site, the first question you may ask yourself is: "What is a WordPress theme?" By answering that question, you can begin customizing your site to fit your branding and appeal to your target audience.
After all, your WordPress website doesn't have to look like every other site on the internet — in fact, it shouldn't.
   In this post, we'll walk you through the intricacies of WordPress website themes.
You'll learn the answer to your question, "What is a WordPress theme?" Plus, you'll learn more about how themes work, how to edit them, and a sampling of some of our favorite themes.

          How do WordPress themes work?
          How to Choose a WordPress Theme           Free WordPress Themes           Best WordPress Themes           WordPress Business Themes                    (Psst: Everyone learns differently.
So if you would rather follow along with a video, here's a handy walkthrough created by TemplateMonster :)     What is a WordPress theme?
  A WordPress theme is a collection of templates, code files, and stylesheets that modify the way a WordPress website is displayed on the front-end, without modifying the core WordPress software.
Some WordPress themes are bundled with a page builder for easy editing and customization.
    According to data from Built With , WordPress powers approximately 38 million websites.
If that isn't enough, WordPress itself even states that 43% of the internet is built on the platform.
That's a lot of WordPress users.
 As you can tell, tons of sites make use of this open-source platform.
That might have you wondering how to ensure your website stands out in a sea of other WordPress sites.
And that's where your site theme comes into the picture.
 Your WordPress theme lets you customize your website — everything from the fonts to the colors.
When you install a theme , you can alter countless elements including the page width, items in the header, branding, layout, and beyond.
 Of course, some themes are picky about what changes you can make, but overall, you'll find that most are highly customizable.
And, of course, if you want to redesign your website, you can accelerate the process by working with a theme.
(And using our handy website redesign checklist , of course.)  Another huge perk of using a WordPress theme is that countless options exist.
If you don't like one theme, don't fret — changing it out for another is easy, and you won't lose any of your pre-existing content.
  How do WordPress themes work?
 It can be tempting to think of a WordPress theme as a "skin " — but in reality, it's much more.
Your WordPress theme provides you with control over how your site is visually presented to visitors, as well as the behavior of your site elements when visitors interact with them.
 For instance, your theme may also control the way certain site elements behave when visitors interact with them.
A mobile responsive theme, for example, may re-order to hide certain elements on the page when a visitors accesses your site from a mobile device.
(Want to learn more about mobile responsive themes?
Here are some of our favorites .)  The reason this is possible is because the theme has its own templates, plugins, and even files.
A WordPress theme consists of a few components, which is why it's crucial to know about them even if you don't plan on editing the files.
 Let's dive into the different terms you should know that are associated with WordPress themes.
 Parent Theme Templates   T hemes look the way they do because of a set of template files that determine the layout, design, and functionality of their pages.
For instance, most themes have a template file for a single page, a single post, a search results page, a 404 page, and a single product page (if it's an ecommerce theme ).
 WordPress themes also contain template files for the footer, header, and sidebar, controlling what goes in them, such as your business logo or your navigation menu.
 Child Theme Templates  Sometimes, you'll find that your theme comes bundled with a child theme .
The reason developers contain child themes is so you ( or your WordPress developer ) can easily alter the theme's template files without impacting the parent files.
 Why is this helpful?
Well, if you make too many changes to your theme and want to revert to the parent theme, doing so is easy.
In addition, you can install an update for your parent theme without losing any customizations in the child theme's files.
 Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)  CSS is a coding language that makes a website "look pretty." Without it, you'd be stuck with the browser's default fonts and colors.
Thanks to CSS, you're able to create a visually appealing website that fits your branding.
 WordPress themes include a CSS stylesheet that influences the website's look and feel.
If you think you need to edit the CSS stylesheet to make the theme look the way you want, don't fear: Most themes provide options in the WordPress admin dashboard to make those changes.
For the most part, you won't need to touch any CSS code.
 PHP File   No matter what WordPress theme you select, it comes with a PHP file.
The file determines the major back-end functionalities of the theme, so you won't need to worry about it unless you're experienced with coding PHP and want to tinker with it.
The only thing you have to do is keep your PHP version up to date — simple enough.
 Page Builder  Unless you're using a theme built by WordPress.org, such as Twenty Twenty-Two , the theme you use will most likely come bundled with a drag-and-drop page builder .
Drag-and-drop page builders are popular because using one enables you to edit your content and alter your website appearance without needing to touch any theme files.
Because of that, it's easy to navigate — even for extreme beginners.
 Most of the time, it won't be necessary to install the page builder separately.
During the installation process, the theme should automatically add the plugin to your WP site administrator area.
If it doesn't come with a built-in page builder, don't worry.
Your theme will then be compatible with one or more options, so you have the freedom to pick whichever works best for you.
 Additional Plugins  Another thing you should keep an eye out for?
Some WordPress themes automatically come bundled with additional plugins to extend your site functionality.
The nature of these plugins depends on what type of theme you install.
Think of it this way: A membership theme will come bundled with a membership plugin .
In the same way, an ecommerce theme will come bundled with an ecommerce plugin .
It wouldn't necessarily make sense for an ecommerce theme to come with a membership plugin or vice versa.
 So once you install your theme, it's wise to review the plugin list and ensure you didn't automatically install a plugin you don't want to use.
This is a wise idea because having too many plugins can slow down your WordPress site.
 To summarize, you can download or purchase a theme to change the appearance and behavior of your WordPress site without touching a single line of code.
Because WordPress themes, like plugins , allow users to create custom sites without coding, they have revolutionized the way we design our sites and create online content.
 So step one is to select your theme — but the work doesn't stop there.
Once you've picked it out, it's time to begin customizing it.
The customization process can be as intense or lowkey as your branding calls for.
If you pick a theme that doesn't need a ton of customization, you can wrap it up relatively quick.
 The customization process can take place directly in your dashboard thanks to the built-in theme editor in WordPress.
Let's take a closer look at this feature below.
 WordPress Theme Editor vs WordPress Customizer  Your WordPress theme editor is a simple text editor that you can find on your WordPress dashboard.
Because it's built-in, you are able to modify your theme files directly on the dash.
 Accessing this editor is easy.
Just log into your admin dashboard and click Appearance > Theme Editor .
  The theme editor will look something like this:   On the right, you'll see all the template files that make up your theme that you can edit in this built-in tool, like the style.css and function.php files.
Notice that the editor selects the style.css file, or stylesheet, by default since that's the most common file to edit.
 There are a few perks of the WordPress theme editor.
It's highly accessible, which makes it an excellent option even for beginner WordPress website creators.
Plus, without the default WordPress theme editor, you would have to log into your hosting control panel, access the File Manager, navigate to your themes folder, and open and edit the specific template files one by one.
The WordPress theme editor eliminates that redundancy.
 That being said, you should still be cautious before you decide to use the WordPress theme editor.
Even with coding experience, it's not recommended that you use the WordPress theme editor for two main reasons.
 The first reason is that you'll be editing your core theme files.
Therefore, if you make any changes, you'll lose them the next time you update the theme — and it's crucial you update the theme regularly to bolster WordPress site security .
 And as for the second reason?
It's even more extreme.
If you make an error when you're editing your theme files, you can break your site entirely.
(If you make backup files, you'll likely be okay; if not, one error could irreparably break your website.)  The good news is that there's another way to edit your site that is less high-stakes.
That's where the WordPress Customizer comes into the picture.
You can access this tool by clicking Appearance > Customize .
Here you can edit the colors, header and background images, menus, widgets, and homepage settings.
Take a look at your options in the screenshot below.
  See the last menu option labeled "Additional CSS?" This is a built-in CSS editor that WordPress offers as an alternative to editing your style.css file in the theme editor.
 In fact, after clicking into the Theme editor, you'll see a message box at the top that says, "There's no need to change your CSS here — you can edit and live preview CSS changes in the built-in CSS editor." You can see it in the screenshot of the theme editor above.
 If you want to edit template files other than the style.css file, then you have a few options.
You can create a child theme, which will allow you to modify the appearance of your WordPress website without editing your theme files directly.
(You can also opt for an option with built-in child themes).
 You can also use a third-party page builder to customize your theme without coding.
Some page builders even come bundled with a theme, such as the famous Divi theme and Divi Builder.
 Before taking a look at a varying selection of free, popular , premium, and business-specific WordPress themes , let's briefly walk through the process of choosing a WordPress theme for your site.
  How to Pick a WordPress Theme  Picking a theme is a can't-skip step in the process of building your WordPress site.
Your theme impacts virtually every aspect of your site, from the design to the speed, performance, SEO , and user experience .
 But how do you evaluate which of the hundreds of themes available in the WordPress directory would be the best fit for your website?
That's not even to mention the slew of third-party marketplaces that sell WordPress site themes.
In a sea of themes, you might be unsure where to begin.
One way to start your search is to consider your site's needs and align them with the features the themes offer.
 Before you select your WordPress theme, you should ask yourself these questions:    What type of design would reflect your brand personality?
   Do you need a variety of layouts or just one?
Are you looking for a theme with built-in social media widgets or any other functionality?
   Would you like to install a demo site or start from scratch?
   Do you want to purchase a theme that includes its own theme builder?
   Would you prefer a back-end or front-end builder?
   Do you need a theme that's compatible with a specific plugin you have installed?
   Pro Tip: If you're using the HubSpot WordPress plugin , check out these high-quality compatible WordPress themes .
 By asking these questions, you'll avoid the common mistake of picking a visually appealing theme that lacks functionality.
Remember: When it comes to a WordPress theme, function is most important.
 Below we'll take an in-depth look at some of the most popular and highly-rated themes.
These themes range in price and purpose, have different authors, and are available in different marketplaces.
By exploring such an array of examples, we hope you'll find a theme that meets your site's needs and goals.
  Our Favorite Free WordPress Themes  One of the first decisions you'll have to make when selecting a theme is whether you want a free or premium one.
 While premium themes offer more features, layouts, and settings, free WordPress themes allow you to experiment with different designs without spending any of your budget.
And because free themes tend to have fewer features and widgets, they are fairly simple and easy to use, even for beginners.
 Below we'll take a look at free themes that are highly rated among the WordPress community.
 Astra Theme   With over a million active installations, it's an understatement to say Astra is popular.
It's lightweight, fast, and integrates with popular page builders, including Elementor .
Because it was optimized according to the best coding standards, Astra loads in less than 0.5 seconds.
Plus, it provides books and filters so developers can easily extend the code.
And did we mention it works with WooCommerce and is SEO-friendly?
 What really makes Astra an impeccable pick is its out-of-the-box features, importable demo sites, and built-in plugin integrations.
As a result, getting your site up and running is quick.
 For more header designs, color controls, blog layouts, and other advanced features, you can purchase Astra Pro .
 Twenty Twenty-Two Theme  Twenty Twenty-Two is the latest default WordPress theme that was built for the Gutenberg editor.
It comes with unique block patterns designed explicitly for the theme.
These patterns are predefined block layouts that are ready to be inserted and tweaked in individual WordPress sites.
 Designed to be a blank canvas for the block editor, Twenty Twenty-Two is a simple and fast-loading theme that site admins can use to build custom content layouts for their posts and pages.
 Though limited in features, this starter theme is perfect for users starting out on WordPress and for techies looking to learn how to modify or create WordPress themes.
Twenty Twenty-Two is an excellent option, especially for building a blog, single-page site, or portfolio.
Because it is highly customizable, you can also build a business site.
 OceanWP Theme   Another well-loved theme, OceanWP boasts over 700,000 active installations.
The multipurpose theme works seamlessly with Elementor, can help you build an ecommerce site, and features SEO-best practices implemented.
This lightweight theme is also responsive and highly extendable.
 OceanWP is ideal for creating WooCommerce storefronts as it has ecommerce features built directly into the theme, including a native cart popup, floating add-to-cart bar, and product quick views.
Because of this, you won't have to download a ton of plugins to make your dream ecommerce site come to life — which can help ensure your pages load quickly.
 OceanWP appeals to users at different skill levels.
Because it's compatible with Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, and other popular page builders, beginners can design their sites quickly.
On the other hand, developers and other advanced users can take advantage of the theme's extensible codebase to make unique customizations.
 OceanWP is one of the fastest-growing themes for WordPress.
The theme is free, but you can purchase bundles of premium extensions, demos, and support.
 Hello Elementor Theme   Image Source  Hello is a clean, lightweight theme designed to work seamlessly with the Elementor page builder.
Written with only the most essential code, Hello offers impressive load times and compatibility with most plugins, including Yoast and WooCommerce.
It also enables developers to easily access and edit the theme's codebase to make any changes they want.
 Hello is ideal for site owners looking to design their site from the ground up, building everything from 404 pages to archives, WooCommerce product pages, and more.
It has over a million active installations and is well-loved for its minimalist design.
 WooCommerce Storefront Theme   Image Source  WooCommerce's Storefront is an excellent option for those seeking a free theme for their ecommerce site.
It integrates with — you guessed it — WooCommerce, is highly flexible, responsive, and adheres to accessibility guidelines — which is an absolute must.
 You can use the built-in WordPress customizer or a page builder like Elementor to customize your store's appearance.
 Storefront offers a limited selection of core features so that it remains lightweight and fast.
You'll likely be able to set up your store with the features provided but if you need additional functionality, then you can find free and premium addons in the WooCommerce Storefront extension catalog .
 Any of the themes above can help you customize the look and feel of your site while keeping your costs low.
However, using a free theme can have its disadvantages.
You risk downloading malicious code, slowing down your site because of a poorly-written theme, or not having support if an error occurs.
 You can minimize these risks by selecting a free theme that is highly rated and available for download from the official WordPress repository or a trusted third-party marketplace, like the ones discussed above.
If you can't find a free theme that suits your needs, however, you can purchase a premium one.
  Best WordPress Themes: Premium  Premium themes offer advanced customization options, a large selection of demos and layouts, and priority support.
Below we’ll look at some of the the best WordPress themes on the market.
From integrated page builders to unique customization options, each has valuable features that will enhance your site.
 Divi Theme   Divi, created by Elegant Themes, is one of the most beloved options for WordPress website creators.
Why?
For starters, it is responsive, fast, and versatile — all hallmarks of an excellent theme.
However, what really sets Divi apart is that it comes with a front-end visual editor.
That means you can customize your pages by adding special effects, inserting calls-to-action, or using any of the other 40 elements.
Once you make changes, you can preview the changes in real-time.
 Divi also has a built-in split testing system, so you can test variations of elements on the page to ensure your site is optimized for your visitors.
The last thing that differentiates Divi from other themes is its pricing model.
By purchasing one license, you can use Divi (or any of the other themes built by Elegant Themes) on unlimited sites.
It also offers more than 200 elements and 2000 pre-designed layouts.
 With its built-in split testing, drag-and-drop visual editor, and over 2000 pre-designed layouts, Divi is an excellent choice for beginners and advanced site owners as well as agencies that build sites for clients.
 Avada Theme  Like Divi, Avada is incredibly popular because of its versatility.
This Gutenberg-optimized, high-resolution, widget-ready theme comes with its own drag-and-drop page builder tool.
Avada has a few key differences from Divi, however, including a one-click demo importer and back-end editor.
 You can get your site up and running in minutes by importing one of Avada's 95 pre-built demo websites, which is particularly appealing to beginners.
More advanced users can choose from over 300 pre-built pages and customize them using Avada's 120+ design elements and built-in page builder.
It's important to note that, unlike Divi's, this builder works on the back end, so you can't see your changes in real-time.
 According to Avada's official site, over 900,000 users have chosen Avada for their site, making it the top-selling WordPress theme at ThemeForest of all time.
 Kallyas Theme  Kallyas is a multipurpose theme that boasts over 70 fully pre-made demo sites.
It combines a lot of the notable features Divi and Avada boasts, which makes it an attractive option.
Similar to Divi, Kallyas's built-in editor, the Zion builder, works on the front end so you can make live edits.
Like Avada, Kallyas has a one-click demo wizard so that you can install one of the 70+ pre-built websites in a single click.
What sets this theme apart from both Divi and Avada is that it offers a ton of design options.
 Porto Theme  Porto Theme is a responsive theme that's ideal for creating online stores.
Compared to other multi-purpose themes with general ecommerce features, Porto provides features and layouts built for WooCommerce stores in particular.
It has a built-in product page builder, pricing tables, shortcodes, multiple footer options for ecommerce sites, and more.
It also features SEO backed by AI, which makes it an appealing option.
 Of Porto's 134+ demos, 44 are specifically designed for ecommerce stores.
What's unique about Porto's demo installation is that you can choose elements from different demos.
You can take a slider from Shop Demo 1, a banner from Shop Demo 12, and a footer from Shop Demo 33 to create your own custom pages in less time.
The result is a highly customized website that suits your unique needs.
 Enfold Theme  Enfold is another responsive multipurpose theme that's highly rated by the WordPress community.
 Like Avada and Kallyas, Enfold provides demo sites that users can install with a single click to create and launch different types of sites quickly.
With 36 pre-built sites currently available, it has a smaller selection than the other two themes but still offers a rich variety.
 Like Avada, Enfold comes with a back-end page builder, so you'll have to save and preview your changes to see what your front-end visitors will see.
While Enfold offers a smaller selection of pre-built content and page elements than Avada and Kallyas, it isn't necessarily a disadvantage.
Site owners that don't need as many out-of-the-box features will appreciate the simpler dashboard and user experience.
 Hestia Theme  You may not need the many features, page templates, customization settings, and options provided by the multi-purpose themes mentioned above.
For a simpler site that’s easy to navigate, a responsive one-page theme like Hestia will align better with your needs.
 While Hestia is compatible with the Gutenberg editor, you can integrate this theme with popular page builders like Elementor and Beaver Builder to customize your pages.
Hestia also includes pre-built sections for your contact info, bio, client testimonials, shop, and more so you can quickly create and launch your site.
 Themeisle offers a free and premium version of this theme.
You can purchase Hestia Pro to add video backgrounds, use multiple headers, and unlock additional functionality.
 Because of its intuitive design and low costs, Hestia is ideal for small businesses and freelancers looking to create a resumé-style website to present their services.
 Daisy  Daisy is the best-selling theme in Mojo Marketplace.
With multiple header styles, 15 blog layouts, five post types, and out-of-the-box social media icons, this responsive theme is ideal for bloggers.
 With your purchase, you'll have access to video tutorials that walk you through the process of setting up your site, from installing Daisy to configuring your SEO settings.
This documentation, combined with Daisy's clean design and simple features, has earned this theme a reputation for being easy to use and beginner-friendly.
 Any of the themes discussed above can help you create beautiful and feature-rich sites.
However, some might be too broad in purpose.
To avoid paying for features you don't need and missing ones you do need, let's look at themes specifically designed for business sites.
  WordPress Business Themes  In addition to price, you can also filter WordPress themes by purpose or niche.
Say you're a consulting firm.
Then you might be looking for a theme that allows visitors to make appointments with you online.
Or, say you're a photographer looking for a minimalist theme that offers a variety of portfolio layouts.
With your niche in mind, you can more seamlessly find a WordPress website theme that suits your unique needs.
 To help you find the right fit for your site, look at a few themes ideal for different types of businesses below.
 Consulting Theme  Consulting is an award-winning business theme in the Themeforest marketplace.
In addition to offering over 50 demos, unlimited header layouts, and more than 120 shortcodes and configuration options, Consulting offers features specifically designed for business sites.
Plus, Consulting provides more than 100 templates in each demo, includes 10 languages, and is high-resolution.
 With this theme, you can add responsive bar charts and graphs, client testimonials, and a pre-built callback request form to your site.
You can also use the theme's built-in appointment manager to allow visitors to book appointments online and add a cost calculator to your site to create quotes or price estimation forms for your WordPress site.
 X Theme  X is a responsive multi-purpose theme like Kallyas.
It comes with a front-end page builder so you can make live edits and also offers 27 pre-built demos to help you easily and quickly launch a site.
 What makes X unique is that it offers four different "stacks" or designs that suit different types of businesses.
You can choose from a flat, minimal, magazine, or all-purpose design when creating your site.
Each has its own unique set of features.
 X is Themeco's top-selling WordPress theme and one of the fastest-selling themes available in the ThemeForest marketplace.
It's used by all types of businesses, including restaurants, tech companies, salons, bands, gyms, non-profits, and more.
 Mai Success Theme  Image Source  Next up is Mai Success.
This theme is block-based and highly customizable.
Therefore, you can use theme-specific block styles to fit the theme to your unique brand needs.
Another key feature of this theme is the one-click setup wizard, which streamlines the process of getting started.
 This theme also offers mobile responsiveness, has a variety of header options, is known for being speedy, and includes Genesis Framework.
 Kalium Theme   Image Source  Kalium is a responsive multipurpose theme that's best suited for businesses and individuals looking to build a portfolio.
Its minimalist design, 100+ customization options, and array of portfolio, project, and blog layouts make Kalium ideal for agencies, restaurants, bookstores, car dealers, gyms, photographers, musicians, artists, freelancers, and more.
It also offers more than 25 pre-made templates, so it won't take you long to get your dream business website up and running.
 Built by coders for coders, Kalium is easy to extend so users with web development experience can customize their site's appearance exactly as they want.
If you lack this technical experience, then you can use the integrated WPBakery page builder to easily create your site by dragging and dropping elements on the page.
 Antreas Pro Theme   Image Source  Antreas Pro is a premium one-page WordPress theme specifically designed for business sites.
 This theme offers built-in social share buttons, author boxes, and related post lists so you can engage your visitors without installing third-party plugins.
It also provides modern grids and layouts for presenting products and services, animation and hover effects for making content stand out on the page, and pricing tables for breaking down your fees and rates.
The theme's responsive design also makes it an attractive option for businesses to capture visitor attention on their mobile devices.
 A free version is available in the WordPress repository as well.
It's limited in functionality but can give you a sense of the theme's design and interface before purchasing Antreas Pro.
 Corporate Theme  Corporate by Themify is a responsive theme designed for businesses to promote their products and services.

Easy to use and no coding necessary.
Built natively into WordPress.
 Get the Plugin          Updated: 06/14/22   Published: 02/18/21        From blogs to complex portals and enterprise websites, millions of sites are powered by WordPress.
In fact, 40.2% of all websites are built on the open-source content management system (CMS).
  Driving the platform’s popularity is its combined ease of use and flexibility.
WordPress provides standard functionality to allow any user to get a site up and running in no time.
 You can create posts and pages, manage and schedule content, assign user roles, upload and insert images and other media, and moderate comments right out-of-the-box.
 Let’s say you do all that and want to continue building your site by customizing your login page or adding social proof to your posts and pages , for example.
Since WordPress is open-source, you could extend or modify the source code to create nearly any functionality your site needs.
Such flexibility is a huge appeal for WordPress developers .
 But what if you’re not a developer and don’t have much experience coding ?
In that case, you can use a plugin.
  WordPress plugins are like apps on your phone.
You can download or purchase them to add or enhance the functionality of your WordPress website .
 Plugins allow WordPress users to create powerful sites without touching a single line of code.
As content management systems continue to democratize web design and abate the dependency on web developers and designers, plugins are an increasingly integral part of how we create and consume content on the internet.
 This post will give you an overview of what WordPress plugins are, how they work, and some of the most popular examples.

          How do WordPress plugins work?
          How to Use a Plugin in WordPress           Must-Have WordPress Plugins           Best WordPress Plugins           Free WordPress Plugins                      What is a WordPress plugin?
  A WordPress plugin is a piece of software that “plugs into” your WordPress site.
Plugins can add new functionality or extend existing functionality on your site, allowing you to create virtually any kind of website, from ecommerce stores to portfolios to directory sites.
    Plugins can make small tweaks on your site or massive changes, depending on their features.
For example, you could use a plugin to add a WhatsApp share button to your site or to create a fully multilingual site .
Or, if you run an ecommerce business, you might install a plugin to assist with payment gateways or allow visitors to book appointments online .
 There are also plugins that can help you enhance your contact forms , make beautiful sliders , backup your site in case of data failure, and make email opt-in easy — plus much more.
 While many make changes to the front end of your site, some plugins make changes on the back end so maintenance is easier for your team.
These plugins might allow you to scan your site for broken links , run A/B tests , or put your site into maintenance mode , for example.
 Now that we have a better understanding of what plugins are, let’s take a closer look at how they work.
    How do WordPress plugins work?
  Plugins allow you to add or extend the functionality of your WordPress site without changing core WordPress files.
Plugins use access points, formally known as filter and action hooks, provided by the WordPress Plugin API to “hook into” the source code.
These access points and methods will call the functions of the plugin at specific times and modify the default behavior of WordPress.
    A plugin developer who wants to use the WordPress Plugin API to create a plugin will start by creating a PHP function to, say, delete comments with profanity from their site.
Then they’ll hook the function to a specific event, such as saving comments to the WordPress database or publishing a post, by using the add_filter() function or add_action() function .
 Let’s say this developer wants to create a plugin that adds a line of text that says “Thank you for reading!” below every post on a WordPress site.
In that case, the function of the plugin would be adding “Thank you for reading!” to a post and the event that triggers the function would be publishing a post.
So their plugin file would look something like the following:    <?php /** * Plugin Name: Thank You Plugin * Plugin URI: http://www.mywebsite.com/thank-you-plugin * Description: The very first plugin that I have ever created.
* Version: 1.0 * Author: Your Name * Author URI: http://www.mywebsite.com */ add_action( 'the_content', 'my_thank_you_text' ); function my_thank_you_text ( $content ) { return $content .= '<p>Thank you for reading!</p>'; ?>   Now let’s say you’re a site owner who wants to add this functionality to your site.
In that case, you'd need to add the plugin to your WordPress website.
Let's look at the different ways you can do so below.
  How to Use a Plugin in WordPress  There are multiple ways can add WordPress plugins to your site.
For example, you can do so from your dashboard, from the official WordPress plugin directory, or from third-party sites.
Plugins from the official directory can be automatically installed in one click, while some premium plugins have to be manually installed via a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client .
 To install a plugin from the official WordPress directory, you simply have to log into your dashboard and select Plugins > Add New .
Then search for the plugin using the built-in search bar.
From there, you just have to click Install and Activate .
 To understand how to install a plugin that's not available in the official directory, let's return to the plugin example above.
If the "Thank you for reading!" plugin is not available in the directory, then you would download the plugin as a zip file and save it in the wp-content/plugins folder of your directory via an FTP client.
This would automatically install the plugin to your WordPress site.
 You’d then navigate to Plugins in your admin dashboard.
Once you located the newly uploaded plugin from the list of installed plugins on your site, you’d just click the plugin’s “Activate” link and be all set! From then on, every time you published a post, the line “Thanks for reading!” would be automatically added to the bottom of the post.
 Most plugins begin working right away, but you may need to configure their settings to ensure they're working the way you want them to.
For example, if you were using the WP Staging – DB & File Duplicator & Migration plugin to set up a WordPress staging site , then you'd need to go to the plugin's settings page and click Create New Staging Site.
Then, enter in some information like the name of the staging site and what content you wanted to be copied.
Otherwise, the plugin wouldn't up a staging site automatically.
 If this sounds like a lot of work, then you might be wondering why people use plugins instead of editing core WordPress files to add functionality to their site.
That’s because, when updating to a new version of WordPress, all the core files — and any edits made to them — are overwritten.
To add that same functionality on your updated site, you’d have to go back in and edit the core files again.
 However, if you install plugins to add functionality to your site, then you just need to worry about keeping the plugins updated .
 Now that we understand what plugins are, how they work, and how to use them, let’s look at some plugins that can add essential features to your WordPress site.

   Download Now: Free WordPress Website Guide + Checklist        Colin Newcomer          Published: February 22, 2023       Struggling to choose between Webflow vs WordPress to build your website?
  These tools are popular solutions that can help you build simple or complex websites without deep technical knowledge.
They offer different approaches to creating a website, so it's essential to understand how they compare to pick the best option for your needs.
 The main difference is that WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) installed on your hosting server, while Webflow is a SaaS application that handles everything for you.
  Here’s a quick video that explains the primary WordPress Webflow differences in regard to the learning curve, customizability, coding knowledge needed, and pricing.
      The differences go much deeper than that, though, so let’s break down WordPress vs Webflow into nine different sections:   Overview  Features  Ease of use  Themes and templates  Plugins and extensions  Integrations with third-party services  Ecommerce functionality  Pricing  Pros and cons     Before directly comparing WordPress vs Webflow, let's see what both platforms offer.
 What is WordPress?
  WordPress is a popular open-source CMS.
It's the most popular way to build a website, powering over 42% of all the websites on the Internet .
 Anyone can download the free WordPress software from WordPress.org and install it on their web hosting to create a site.
 Note that in this article, we're focused on the open-source WordPress software at WordPress.
org .
This differs from WordPress.
com , which is one specific service that helps you use the WordPress.org software.
 WordPress started as a blogging platform, but it's since evolved into a full-service CMS that can handle any site, from business websites to portfolios, eCommerce stores, directories, and more.
 One of WordPress's strengths is its extensions.
You can use two types of extensions to adapt the core WordPress software to your needs:   Themes —hese control the design of your site.
 Plugins — These add new features to your site.
  WordPress is highly reliant on using extensions — every WordPress website uses multiple plugins to add key features.
 This is a philosophical difference between WordPress vs Webflow: The core WordPress software is a foundation that you customize by adding plugins, whereas Webflow is a finished SaaS application where everything is built into the tool.
 For more on WordPress, you can read our full post on what WordPress is .
 Webflow vs.
WordPress: What is Webflow?
 Webflow is a SaaS platform that helps you build a website using a visual drag-and-drop builder.
It's primarily marketed towards designers looking for a low-code or no-code tool to build websites, but anyone can use Webflow to create a website.
 The key difference between Webflow and other SaaS website builders, such as Squarespace and Wix, is that Webflow still gives you access to your site's underlying code.
Essentially, the visual builder gives you a visual tool to generate your site's HTML , CSS, and JavaScript.
 For dynamic sites, Webflow also includes its own CMS that you can use to create a blog, eCommerce store, directory, and more.
W ith little help from JavaScript, you can even build a Spacerbar Counter with Webflow.
 As a SaaS application, Webflow is mostly self-contained.
You can add features to your site by embedding code, but the core Webflow platform is all you need to build your site, or h ire a Webflow agency to do that for you.
 Once you finish building your site with Webflow, you can either…   Export the code of your finished site and host it on any hosting provider if you have a static site.
 Pay Webflow to host the site for you, which is required if you want to use Webflow's CMS for dynamic content.
  Next, let's take a basic look at the high-level features of both tools.
  Features  WordPress and Webflow offer everything you need to build a website, though you'll need to rely on WordPress plugins to add some features.
These features are marked with an asterisk in the table below:     Features    WordPress    Webflow      Pre-made themes/templates    ✔️    ✔️      Visual, drag-and-drop design    ✔️*    ✔️      Full content management system    ✔️    ✔️      Static HTML sites    ✔️*    ✔️      Blogging    ✔️    ✔️      E-commerce    ✔️*    ✔️      Full code access    ✔️    ✔️      SEO optimization    ✔️*    ✔️      SSL certificates    ✔️    ✔️      Performance optimization    ✔️*    ✔️     Of course, there are more nuanced feature differences, which you'll see in the sections below.
But at a high level, both WordPress and Webflow can do everything that most site owners need.
  Ease of Use  The advantage of both WordPress and Webflow over other solutions is that they make it easy to build a website, even if you don't know anything about coding .
 Of the two, WordPress has a smaller learning curve — especially if you know nothing about HTML and CSS —but non-developers can use both.
 To give you an idea of the ease of use of each platform, let's go through what it's like to build a website with each.
 WordPress Ease of Use  To start your WordPress website , you'll need to purchase web hosting and install the WordPress software.
 Because WordPress is so popular, most web hosts offer simple installer tools that let you install and configure the WordPress software with just a few clicks.
 Here are some examples of WordPress installers from WordPress :   Once you've installed WordPress, you can manage your site from the WordPress dashboard.
It looks like this:   To control the design of your site, you can install a WordPress theme .
Think of themes like your website's clothing.
You can easily change the appearance of your site without losing any content by replacing the theme:   If you want even more design control, you can install a plugin that offers visual, drag-and-drop editing .
For example, here's what it looks like to design your site with the Elementor plugin :   To create content, such as writing a blog post , you can use the WordPress Gutenberg editor .
The editor uses a block-based system, which makes it easy to set up multi-column designs and incorporate elements such as buttons:   If you want more design control, you can always keep using your page builder plugin .
 To manage all of your site's content, settings, users, user comments, and so on, you'll get dedicated screens within the WordPress dashboard.
 Overall, you can do everything without looking at a single line of code.
Or, if you are a more advanced user, you still have full access to your site's underlying HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
 Webflow  Luckily, learning how to use Webflow is easy as it’s rather intuitive.
To get started with a Webflow website, simply register for a Webflow account.
 When you sign up, Webflow will launch a short survey to tailor the experience to your needs.
Then, it launches a guide to help you learn important concepts such as containers and styling.
  Once you have the basics down, you can create your own website project.
You can either start from a blank slate or choose a preset template:   Then, you can build your site using Webflow's visual, drag-and-drop builder.
One of the highlights of Webflow's builder is that it gives you control over every element and style choice on your site:   If you want to use dynamic content on your site, such as blog posts, you can enable Webflow's CMS functionality.
 When learning how to use Webflow, you can get started with a stripped-down editor to add your blog post content .
You can easily insert images and videos, but the blog content editor isn't nearly as flexible as the block editor that WordPress offers:   To make your Webflow website live, you have two options:   You can pay Webflow to host it for you.
You'll need to choose this option if you have a dynamic site that needs the Webflow CMS (e.g. a blog or eCommerce store).
 You can export your site's static code and host it anywhere.
   Themes and Templates  To help you create a great-looking website without needing to design it from scratch, both WordPress and Webflow let you apply pre-made designs to your site.
 WordPress calls these themes, while Webflow calls them templates.
 WordPress, being the more popular web builder .
If you want the most flexibility in terms of finding an off-the-rack design for your website, WordPress is the definite winner.
Take a look at the numbers below to compare.
      WordPress    Webflow      Free Themes/Templates    5,300+    50+      Premium Themes/Templates    10,000+    1400+      Plugins and Extensions  While both WordPress and Webflow offer all the tools you need to build a website, you might want to extend your site with features that go beyond those in the core platform.
 Typically, most website builders allow this via extensions, though the terminology differs.
These extensions can be called " plugins ” "apps," or, "extensions."  WordPress  With WordPress, you get a massive collection of plugins that you can use to add features to your site.
For example, the official WordPress.org directory has almost 59,000 free plugins.
You can also find thousands of premium plugins via other marketplaces or independent developers.
  Again, WordPress assumes that you will use these plugins to enhance the functionality of your site , such as improving SEO or making your site mobile-friendly .
 Webflow  Webflow doesn't offer official plugins like WordPress does, which means you can't add extensions that work directly in the Webflow interface.
 However, that doesn't mean you can't extend your site with new features.
You can extend Webflow by integrating code snippets from other services.
 For example, if you want to add live chat to your site, you could integrate the JavaScript snippet from your favorite live chat service .
If you want to set up a membership site with Webflow, you could integrate Memberstack .
 However, these code snippet integrations can often feel a bit like workarounds, whereas WordPress plugins are fully native solutions.
  Integrations With Third-Party Services  To get the most from your website, you'll want to be able to integrate with the other tools that you're using, such as your customer relationship manager (CRM) , your email marketing provider , and so on.
 WordPress  WordPress excels when it comes to integrations because you can find plugins for pretty much any integration imaginable.
 Want to integrate HubSpot into your WordPress website?
You can use the dedicated HubSpot WordPress plugin to not just connect your WordPress site to HubSpot, but also to access the HubSpot CRM and other key actions without leaving your WordPress dashboard.
 If you need more advanced integrations, you can find tools such as WP Webhooks and Uncanny Automator that let you set up custom automation rules to connect to other services.
 Overall, the ease at which you can integrate WordPress with the other tools that you're using is definitely one of its advantages.
 Webflow  Webflow isn't quite as strong when it comes to integrations.
You can  integrate your Webflow site with other tools , but you won't get nearly as many native integrations, which means you'll need to rely on code embeds and separate interfaces in many situations.
 For example, if you want to embed a HubSpot lead gen form, you'd need to first build your form in HubSpot and then add it to Webflow using the embed code from HubSpot.
 You'll find the same situation for other services that you want to integrate.
  Ecommerce Functionality  Both WordPress and Webflow can help you create an ecommerce store .
 With WordPress, you can add full ecommerce functionality using a plugin.
WooCommerce is by far the most popular WordPress ecommerce plugin.
In fact, WooCommerce is the most popular way to build an ecommerce store overall , even beating out dedicated ecommerce platforms.
  With Webflow, the ecommerce features are built into the core Webflow service, as long as you pay for the ecommerce plan.
   Pricing  Now, let's talk about what it will cost you to access all of the features above.
 Of the two platforms, WordPress has the potential to be cheaper.
That is, if you're looking for the absolute cheapest way to make a website, WordPress beats out Webflow.
 However, there are a lot of variables with pricing, especially for WordPress.
Let's go through the details.
 WordPress Pricing  The core open-source WordPress software is 100% free.
However, at a minimum, you'll need your own web hosting to power the WordPress software , which will cost money.
 For a low-traffic site, you can find hosting for $5-$10 per month.
For example, SiteGround, one of our recommended WordPress hosts , starts at $14.99 per month ( depending on the current promotion ).
 However, those prices are unrealistic for a high-traffic site (100,000+ monthly visitors), as most budget hosts won't be able to maintain performance.
For a high-traffic site, you'll need to spend $20+ per month.
 Paying for your web hosting (and domain name) is the only unavoidable cost of running a WordPress site.
However, depending on your feature and design needs, you might want to also pay for a premium WordPress theme and/or premium plugins.
 Most premium WordPress themes cost $50-60, while premium plugins can vary in price anywhere from $10 to $100+.
 All in, you could run a simple WordPress site for as little as $50-$75 per year, but a more realistic price would be $150-$350 per year to allow for some premium plugins and themes and potentially upgraded hosting .
 Webflow  Webflow lets you sign up and build your website for free — no credit card required.
 However, you'll need to sign up for a paid plan when you want to make your website live and accessible to other people.
 Webflow offers two types of plans:   Site plans — you need a site plan for every single site that you want to host on Webflow's service.
Note — you aren't forced to use Webflow's hosting service for static sites.
  Workspaces plans — you need a workspaces plan to have more than two website projects.
The paid workspaces plans allow multiple people to work on a project with you.
  If you plan to host your websites on Webflow and use the Webflow CMS, you'll need a site plan for each website you want to host.
 If you're just using Webflow to create and design websites you'll host elsewhere and/or hand off to clients, then you need a workspaces plan.
 In some situations, you might need to pay for both a site plan and a workspaces plan.
 Webflow Site Plans  Webflow offers both regular site plans and eCommerce site plans.
The regular site plans start for free but can go as high as $39 per month with annual billing:   However, if you want a blog or other content-driven site, you'll need at least the $23 per month CMS plan.
 Beyond the service, you also might want a paid Webflow template.
These typically cost $49-$79, though some are priced lower or higher.
 All in all, you could run a simple static Webflow site for $144 per year.
However, a more realistic price is $240-$450 to account for dynamic functionality and a premium template.
 Webflow Workspaces Plans  The free Webflow Workspaces plan lets you have up to two website projects, but you can't export code or transfer them to other Webflow accounts.
 The paid plans start at $19 per month for up to 10 projects and exports/transfers:      WordPress vs Webflow: Pros and Cons  To finish out our WordPress vs Webflow comparison, let's compare the pros and cons of each platform.
 Pros  WordPress   WordPress is free and open-source.
 WordPress has a lower learning curve than Webflow (unless you're already familiar with HTML and CSS).
 Because WordPress powers more than 42% of all websites on the Internet, it's very easy to find WordPress learning resources .
 The huge plugin library lets you easily add features to your site without resorting to workaround code embeds.
 WordPress integrates with more third-party tools and at a deeper level.
 It can be cheaper to create a site with WordPress if you're on a budget.
  Webflow   Webflow's visual editor is very powerful, which is why designers love it.
 Webflow gives you everything you need to build a basic site in the core package — no need to add plugins.
 Webflow offers direct customer support for paying customers.
 Webflow offers better out-of-the-box performance optimization.
You can make WordPress sites load very fast, but it requires some manual effort.
  Cons  WordPress :   Because WordPress is self-hosted software, you'll be responsible for maintenance and security, including updates.
 WordPress sites can feel more complicated because WordPress relies on plugins to add key features.
 WordPress doesn't offer direct customer support (though it's easy to find community support).
 You will need extensive coding knowledge to customize your website — or be willing to pay a WordPress developer to do it for you.
  Webflow :   While Webflow's editor is flexible, it can feel overwhelming if you're not familiar with some basic HTML and CSS principles.
 Webflow doesn't have a huge plugin library like WordPress.
While this makes things simpler, it's also more limiting.
 Webflow doesn't integrate with as many third-party tools as WordPress does.
For the integrations that exist, they aren't as deep as WordPress.
 Webflow can be more expensive.
  Build Your Website Today  WordPress and Webflow are both excellent solutions to build a website.
Which tool you choose really depends on what you value in a content management system.
 For most individuals and businesses looking to make a website, WordPress is the better choice because it's more flexible and integrates with more tools.
It can also be cheaper and will have a lower learning curve if you're not already familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS.
 With that being said, if you're a web designer or someone who builds a lot of client sites for a living, you might prefer Webflow because many of its features are targeted towards helping designers build websites faster.
If you understand the basics of HTML/CSS but lack a deeper understanding of coding, Webflow offers you more customization options.
 Finally, it's worth noting that you don't always need to choose between Webflow vs WordPress.
With the official Webflow Pages plugin for WordPress, you can build pages for your WordPress site using Webflow.

  Nov 15, 2022                       12 Best HTML & CSS Code Editors for 2023    Download Now: Free HTML & CSS Coding Templates        Anna Fitzgerald     Published: April 03, 2024       An HTML and CSS code editor provides the functionality you need to write code faster and easier, like syntax highlighting, error-flagging, and auto-completion.
Even if you have limited coding skills, the right editor will help you efficiently build a website.
  Below, we’ll cover what a code editor is and key features you can expect.
Then, we'll look at code editors that range in functionality, price, and purpose so you can pick the one that best suits your experience, budget, and business.
Let’s get started.
  HTML Code Editor  An HTML code editor is a type of software that web developers use to create and edit HTML code so they can build web applications faster and easier.
There are two types of HTML editors: WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") editors and text editors.
 Let’s go over each, and why you might want to use one over the other.

        WYSIWYG Code Editors  WYSIWYG editors are exactly as they sound — they allow you to see what you’re editing as you’re editing it, as opposed to writing a line of HTML and CSS code, and then previewing the result in another window.
Drag-and-drop page builders are a great example of WYSIWYG editors.
 WYSIWYG HTML editors are great for beginner coders because they display what the website will look like on the front end to your visitors.
This type of editor will often have a drag-and-drop interface so you can add, delete, and modify headings, images, and other elements on the page without writing or editing a single line of code.
 WYSIWYG editors may be a standalone tool, or come integrated with your web host or CMS.
For example, HubSpot's free CMS includes a drag-and-drop builder .
 Text-Based Code Editors  Text editors are the exact opposite of WYSIWYG editors.
Instead of allowing you to edit the page using live visual elements, you edit the page’s code directly first — and then you can preview it in a browser or the editor’s preview pane.
 A text editor won’t show you what your website will look like on the front end, but it will offer greater flexibility and customizability.
For instance, you’ll be able to more easily create classes, IDs, and so forth without needing to use a WYSIWYG editor’s potentially clunky CSS settings.
 Text editors are a better fit for intermediate to advanced web designers and web developers, because they require you to write and edit code instead of dragging and dropping elements on the page.
 If you’re frightened by the prospect of editing code directly, text editors offer useful features like autocompletion and error detection to help you write code better and faster.
 In this post, we’ll be covering text-based editors only.
But if you identify as a beginner or would rather not have to code, you can always opt for a WYSIWYG drag-and-drop page builder .
 Now, let's take a look at the key features you should look for when evaluating HTML and CSS editors.
 HTML and CSS Editor Features  Every HTML and CSS editor is unique, but most share common features that make it easier and faster to code web applications.
Let's take a closer look at these features.
 Autocompletion  One of the best features of HTML and CSS editors is autocompletion.
With autocompletion, the code editor automatically suggests how to complete a line of code as you write.
These suggestions are based on language semantics and your existing code.
 The suggestions for possible completions of the line of code will narrow down as you type.
  Image Source  Syntax Highlighting  A code editor uses syntax highlighting to display code in different colors and styles in order to make it easier to read.
For example, if the text file is being written in JavaScript, then the code editor will highlight keywords, strings, and comments in different colors.
  Image Source  Error Detection  Some code editors will automatically scan for, detect, and highlight syntax errors, or spelling and punctuation errors in your code.
This will help you catch and fix any mistakes before you run your code.
  Image Source  Search and Replace  When building out a web application, you'll be working with lots of code.
If you need to find a particular piece of code and replace it, you don't want to have to go through every single line manually.
That's why code editors offer search and replace tools: you can find and replace a variable or another piece of code all at once.
  Image Source  Split-Screen View  When writing code, you may want to edit and view multiple files at once, or multiple parts of the same file.
You can with a code editor that offers a split-screen view, like Notepad++.
 Image Source  Customizable Interface  Some code editors offer a customizable user interface so you can tweak it according to your preferences and workflow.
For example, you may opt for a ribbon menu or a simpler toolbar that shows your most commonly used features.
  Image Source  Integrated FTP capabilities  When using a code editor, you may need to make quick edits to a file on a server.
In that case, you want a code editor with integrated FTP capabilities.
That way, you can work with remote files and interact with servers from a single application.
  Image Source    Best HTML and CSS Editors    UltraEdit  NoteTab  Notepad++  Sublime Text  TextPad  BBEdit  Komodo IDE  Visual Studio Code  Atom  Edit+  Bluefish      The best HTML and CSS editors will provide the functionality you need to write code correctly — and to write it faster thanks to autocompletion.
Ideally, this type of editor will provide a clean interface, give you the features you need, and work in your preferred operating system.

 Access now     Learn more           HubSpot’s Content Hub provides a very nice WYSIWYG editor built right into the software, removing the need to find an external editor.
However, there are many editors available online, all of which boast a large number of features.
 Below we’ll take a closer look at the best-rated editors on G2.
 1.
UltraEdit : Best for Advanced Web Programmers   G2 Rating : 4.7 out of 5 stars  UltraEdit is designed to be an all-in-one solution.
It solves every challenge a developer or IT professional faces: programming and project management, text data and record reformatting, data sorting, large file manipulation, remote file operations, advanced file searching, and more.
 That means it’s ideal for advanced users working on their own or in enterprise companies.
It’s not for beginners or hobbyists, and the price reflects this.
It also does not provide a starting point or a template with the basics already included, like a basic HTML document.
For that reason, it would be best for experienced web developers.
 One thing I noticed as I was testing out this tool is that it can handle large files efficiently due to the built-in FTP.
It also supports multiple programming languages with syntax highlighting (including JSON!) and offers advanced search and replace functionalities with regex options, which I found extremely helpful.
I also appreciated its customizable interface, multi-caret editing, and extensive plugin support.
 Features   Custom themes and layouts : If you’d like your text editor to look a certain way, UltraEdit allows you to choose a different theme depending on your preferences.
 Built-in FTP : UltraEdit includes a built-in FTP client that allows you to transfer large files safely and quickly from cPanel or another tool.
 Multi-caret editing : Working on a large website or project can be cumbersome, especially if you have similar lines to edit repeatedly.
Multi-caret or multi-cursor editing allows you to make bulk changes without having to edit individual elements.
 Column-editing mode : This is a unique feature I haven’t run across in other editors.
UltraEdit allows you to edit code in columns, which I found useful for debugging and editing blocky code.
  Pros   A feature-rich, comprehensive solution for developers and IT professionals  Can easily handle large file edits without impacting performance  Effective search and organization functionality  Integrated FTP client  Supports Git integration  Live preview feature   Cons     Steepest price point on this list  Some users cite minor UI flaws     Operating Systems   Windows  Mac  Linux   Price  UltraEdit is available as a subscription or a one-time purchase.
Subscriptions are $79.95 and $99.95 annually.
One-time purchases are $119.95 and $189.95.
 2.
NoteTab : Best for Bootstrap CSS Editing in Windows   G2 Rating : 4.7 out of 5 stars  NoteTab gives you complete control over your HTML code and speeds up the creation process.
As I was testing out this editor, I could insert tags and other HTML code from a toolbar, drag and drop code snippets from a list to my document or insert them using a keyboard, and use the auto-complete feature to insert tags as I typed.
There’s also a multilingual spell checker and a customized input controller for syntax highlighting.
 What really sets NoteTab apart is that it’s the only HTML editor offering support for Bootstrap CSS .
This will enable you to build a Bootstrap site faster with NoteTab than with any other editor.
 Like UltraEdit, NoteTab is capable of handling large files efficiently due to a handy built-in FTP client.
And maybe the best part of all — the tool also works as a plain text editor, which can be handy if you’re looking for a versatile tool with two potential uses.
That does mean that it’s simpler than other options, so I recommend it if you’re looking for an effective frills-free option.
 Some drawbacks are that NoteTab does not support Git.
It also currently only offers syntax highlighting for HTML, XML, and CSS files, so this is not for you if you’re working with JavaScript, PHP, or other programming languages.
When I was using it with large code files, I also found that it crashed sometimes — a problem that can be resolved by constant saving.
 Features   Dual text and HTML editor: If you’re looking for a text editor in addition to an HTML editor, NoteTab is a great choice.
Simple enough to edit text, but complex enough to handle complicated HTML files.
 Built-in FTP : NoteTab includes a built-in FTP client that allows you to transfer large files safely and quickly from cPanel or another tool.
 Bootstrap code library : Using the Bootstrap CSS framework can save time, but only if you’re already well-acquainted with the language and syntax.
NoteTab includes a code library that allows you to easily build a Bootstrap-based website.
 Customizable keyboard shortcuts : One unique feature that could be useful to experienced web developers is the ability to create custom shortcuts for streamlined editing.
  Pros   Flexible enough to support the needs of a range of developers  Large extension library for further customization  Clipbook feature for saving, re-using, and organizing frequently used code snippets  Supports the Bootstrap CSS framework   Cons   Only highlights HTML, XMS, and CSS syntax  No Git integration   Operating Systems    Windows    Price  NoteTab is available as a free light version and as a paid version, which retails for $39.95.
 3.
Notepad++ : Best for Beginner Web Programmers Using Windows   G2 Rating : 4.6 out of 5 stars  Notepad++ is a free, open-source code editor that’s specifically designed for novice programmers.
Like other code editors, it offers syntax highlighting and autocorrect.
What sets Notepad++ apart is how many languages it supports, how many files you can load and work on simultaneously, and how lightweight it is.

           Free Guide: 25 HTML & CSS Coding Hacks  Tangible tips and coding templates from experts to help you code better and faster.
     Coding to Convention     Being Browser-Friendly     Minimizing Bugs     Optimizing Performance     Download for free          Loading your download form    You're all set!  Click this link to access this resource at any time.
 Access now     Learn more           In addition to HTML and CSS, Notepad++ supports 75 other programming languages.
You can open up different file formats in these different languages at the same time and make edits without having to worry about using a ton of CPU power or causing slow load times.
 For a free tool, I found Notepad++ to be a mighty beast.
It includes everything you need for web development, though I’d hesitate to use it for more demanding programming projects due to its limits on log file size.
One thing I loved — that’s common in more expensive tools, so it’s excellent to find it for free — is its multi-tab editing feature and macro recorder, which allowed me to automate cumbersome tasks.
 Some limitations make this editor less than ideal for some users.
First, Notepad++ only works for Microsoft Windows.
If you’re working on any other operating system, like macOS for example, then you’ll have to use another editor.
Second, Notepad++ does not offer support for Git.
If you want to push code to a repository directly from your editor, you’ll be better off using an alternative such as UltraEdit.
 I also found the UI a little plain and outdated for my tastes, but functionality is more important in a code editor than looks.
 Features   Open-source: NotePad++ is open-source software, meaning that you could potentially edit its program code for personal or commercial purposes.
 Built-in FTP : NotePad++ includes a built-in FTP client that allows you to edit code live and transfer large files safely.
 Macro recorder : If you find yourself doing certain tasks repeatedly, NotePad++ includes a macro recorder that allows you to record the actions you take, then re-run them later.
 Lightweight : NotePad++ is a lightweight tool compared to other options on this list.
If you’re concerned about the toll on your CPU, NotePad++ is the tool for you — just remember that it’s not ideal for projects bigger than 20GB.
  Pros   Free and open-source  Lightweight and fast  Supports a wide range of programming languages  Completely customizable UI   Cons   Somewhat outdated interface  No Git integration   Operating Systems   Windows   Price  Notepad++ is free.
 4.
Sublime Text : Best for Experienced Web Programmers Using macOS   G2 Rating : 4.5 out of 5 stars  Sublime Text is like the Notepad++ for macOS users with sophisticated needs.
It’s compatible with a wide variety of programming languages like Notepad++, including C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 It offers the standard features that Notepad++ offers — and so much more, including cross-platform support, split editing, and multiple-selection editing.
In exchange for this power and flexibility, you’ll have a steeper learning curve, though.
 For example, you can use a variety of keyboard shortcuts to quickly execute tasks in Sublime Text — as long as you can remember them.
You can customize virtually everything in the editor, from key bindings to menus to snippets and more — as long as you have the time.
 As I was testing this tool, I noticed that the interface was fairly limited at first, which can lengthen the learning curve because you have to decide, slowly, what you’d like to hide and view in your workspace.
I found the interface fairly intuitive once I started customizing my editing environment, though.
 All of these features are included in the free version of Sublime, but this version eventually starts displaying popups prompting you to purchase a premium license.
 Features   Split View: Sublime Text allows you to edit multiple tabs of code side-by-side in the same window.
Not only is this a fantastic time-saver for editing different types of files, but it also allows you to find definitions, references, or anything else you might need without navigating away from your original code.
 Macro recorder : If you find yourself doing certain tasks repeatedly, Sublime Text includes a macro recorder that allows you to record the actions you take, then re-run them later.
It also includes premade macros for deleting and adding lines of code.
 Multi-caret editing : Working on a large website or project can sometimes be overly cumbersome, especially if you have similar lines to edit repeatedly.
Multi-caret or multi-cursor editing allows you to make bulk changes without having to edit individual elements.
 Customizable keyboard shortcuts : One unique feature that could be useful to experienced web developers is the ability to create custom shortcuts for streamlined editing.
  Pros   Sleek, simple, user-friendly interface with customizable color coding  Split-screen editing and multiple-selection editing  Built-in file organizer for easy navigating and locating   Cons   Paid version is pricey  No built-in package manager for installing third-party plugins  Free version occasionally prompts you with pop-ups to purchase the pro version   Operating Systems   Windows  Mac  Linux   Price  Sublime Text is available as a free version, or you can purchase a license for $80.
 5.
TextPad : Best for Clutter-Free Text and Basic HTML Editing on Windows   G2 Rating : 4.4 out of 5 stars  TextPad is a simple and intuitive editor for Windows that’s ideal for plain text files, but that could be used for basic programming projects due to its ability to handle large files and record macros.
Its interface can seem austere when compared to others, but that’s purposeful.
It’s designed to be so simple that you can use it right away.
 TextPad allows you to edit multiple files simultaneously, drag and drop text between files, indent blocks of text, split or join lines, insert whole files, and undo and redo any changes down to the very first change you made on your document.
TextPad also comes with a customizable toolbar and built-in file manager so you can easily copy, rename, or delete files.
I also found it easy to compare two files.

           Free Guide: 25 HTML & CSS Coding Hacks  Tangible tips and coding templates from experts to help you code better and faster.
     Coding to Convention     Being Browser-Friendly     Minimizing Bugs     Optimizing Performance     Download for free          Loading your download form    You're all set!  Click this link to access this resource at any time.
 Access now     Learn more           I would recommend it for more basic coding projects, despite its ability to handle file sizes all the way to your machine’s limits.
It offers syntax highlighting, but I think other options on this list are better options due to TextPad’s limited color palette.
It’s just not as user-friendly, especially if you prefer dark mode.
Another aspect I found challenging is that if you record a macro, you can’t edit or trim it after the fact.
 Lastly, it’s not updated as often as other editors on this list, which can make the product feel more stagnant.
 Features   Dual text and HTML editor: If you’re looking for a text editor in addition to an HTML editor, TextPad is a great choice.
Simple enough to edit text, but complex enough to handle HTML files.
However, I would caution against using it for complicated projects.
 Macro recorder : If you find yourself doing certain tasks repeatedly, TextPad includes a macro recorder that allows you to record the actions you take, then re-run them later.
 Ability to handle large files : One of TextPad’s most distinctive features is its ability to open large files without crashing.
If you constantly work with extensive log files, for instance, TextPad can easily open them for you.
 Search and replace : Like some of the other options on this list, TextPad allows you to search and replace with regular expressions (regex), allowing you to find what you need quickly.
  Pros   Simple and intuitive for both new and savvy programmers  Capable of simultaneously editing multiple files and dragging code between them  Offers user interface in nine languages   Cons   Infrequent updates  Somewhat antiquated interface   Operating Systems   Windows   Price  TextPad is $16.50 for one license.
However, TextPad also lets users download beta versions for free to test them.

BBEdit : : Best for Clutter-Free Text and Basic HTML Editing on macOS   G2 Rating : 4.5 out of 5 stars  BBEdit (short for “BareBones Edit”) is a code editor for macOS that offers a free and premium version.
It makes it easy to create, import, and edit files and to search for and replace text across multiple documents.
With this editor, you can also compare two text files and analyze them to find any missing, extra, or similar text between them.
 Though this tool is simple at a surface level, it has a built-in FTP client that allows you to import large files.
It also supports a wide variety of programming languages, with functional syntax highlighting.
 As I was testing this tool, I noticed that it opens a plain document that’s reminiscent of Microsoft Word, emphasizing its dual use case for both code and text editing.
I found it great for manipulating large blocks of text and building basic websites with beginner-friendly options I hadn’t encountered before.
For instance, it includes a dialog-based process for adding a head to your HTML document and creating new CSS declarations.
 It’s ideal for developers looking for basic functionality or wanting to learn the ropes of coding before using a more advanced tool.
For anything beyond that, like error checking and debugging, you’ll need a more advanced editor.
 Features   Dual text and HTML editor: If you’re looking for a text editor in addition to an HTML editor, BBEdit is a great choice for macOS users.
Simple enough to edit text, but complex enough to handle programming files.
 Built-in FTP : BBEdit includes a built-in FTP client that allows you to edit code live and transfer large files safely.
 Markup dialog boxes : Instead of typing out lines of code, BBEdit allows you to insert entire declarations via dialog boxes.
It even includes a color picker for color-based declarations in CSS.
 Search and replace : Like some of the other options on this list, BBEdit allows you to search and replace with regular expressions (regex), allowing you to find what you need quickly.
  Pros   Basic but capable user interface is ideal for those looking for a simple tool  Contextual text coloring  Handy file comparison feature   Cons   Some users have reported occasional performance issues   Operating Systems   Mac   Price  BBEdit is available as a free version and a paid version, which retails for $49.99.
 7.
Komodo IDE : Best for Advanced Python and JavaScript Programmers   G2 Rating : 4.4 out of 5 stars  Komodo IDE is a unique code editor because it also serves as an integrated development environment (or IDE for short ).
Your workflow will improve with this editor because it is a two-in-one editor and debugger.
Python, PHP, Perl, Go, Ruby, Node.js, and JavaScript are all supported languages in Komodo IDE.
You can, of course, use it for HTML and CSS as well, but its development support for other languages is a huge plus.
 Live previews are one of the many benefits of this code editor.
Instead of flipping back and forth between tabs, you can edit and test all in one screen.
With automatic saving, you'll never have to wait before reviewing a preview of your work.
 I seriously loved the side-by-side previewing option; other tools on this list opened up the preview in another window.
Seeing it all at once allowed me to make changes and see the change instantly, which could be useful for beginner programmers.
That said, due to the complicated user interface and steep learning curve, I’d recommend this tool only to advanced developers.
 Komodo IDE is merged with ActiveState, which also provides language distributions like ActivePerl and ActivePython.
That can be helpful if you need an enterprise coding solution.

           Free Guide: 25 HTML & CSS Coding Hacks  Tangible tips and coding templates from experts to help you code better and faster.
     Coding to Convention     Being Browser-Friendly     Minimizing Bugs     Optimizing Performance     Download for free          Loading your download form    You're all set!  Click this link to access this resource at any time.
 Access now     Learn more           Features   Split View: Komodo IDE allows you to edit multiple tabs of code side-by-side in the same window.
Not only is this a fantastic time-saver for editing different types of files, but it also allows you to find definitions, references, or anything else you might need without navigating away from your code.
 Open-source: Komodo IDE is open-source software, meaning that you could potentially edit its program code for personal or commercial reasons.
 Extensively customizable : Unlike other tools on this list, Komodo IDE allows you to customize the interface down to the syntax highlighting colors.
 Git integration : With Komodo IDE, you can easily add, remove, and compare files from a Git repository.
The tool also includes support for other Source Code Control systems such as Mercurial, Bazaar, CVS, Subversion, and Perforce.
  Pros   Offers an integrated development environment, not just a code editor  Live previews of the results of your code  Autosaves your work  Efficient debugging mode  Ability to customize colors and syntax highlighting   Cons   Not ideal for those looking for a lightweight editor without an IDE component  Resource-intensive to operate   Operating Systems   Windows  Mac  Linux   Price  Komodo IDE is free.
 8.
Visual Studio Code : Best for Advanced Web and Software Development   G2 Rating : 4.6 out of 5 stars  Visual Studio Code is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform editor from Microsoft.
Rather than the standard syntax highlighting and autocomplete, VS Code offers IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.
 This makes it a powerful solution for debugging your code, especially if you’re a software developer.
VS Code also integrates with Git so you can push code to, or pull from, any hosted SCM service.
 If you're looking for even more functionality, VS Code offers plenty of extensions.
You can add new languages, themes, and debuggers, and connect to additional services.
I found one major drawback, though: There’s no built-in preview tool, which can be frustrating for developers working primarily with HTML or PHP.
 When I was testing out VSCode, I was wowed by the built-in Emmet functionality .
Essentially, all I had to do was type a few lines of shorthand and it would expand it into an entire HTML element I could then customize.
 Visual Studio Code is the only option to offer a web-based version.
If you need to quickly edit code, don’t want to download a new program, or simply want to test whether VSCode is for you, using the web version is a great way to test it out.
This is especially a good option if you’re worried about the resources this tool would need to run on your machine; it’s famously resource-intensive.
 Features   Emmet snippets: VSCode includes Emmet snippets right in the editor, allowing you to write the right code more quickly.
For instance, you can use shorthand to create an entire HTML element, such as a table, that would have taken minutes to write out manually.
 Open-source: Visual Studio Code is open-source software, meaning that you could potentially edit its program code for personal or commercial reasons.
 Extensively customizable : VSCode has an entire marketplace dedicated to it, which allows you to freely install a wide variety of plugins and extensions.
 Built-in Git : With Visual Studio Code, you can easily add, remove, and compare files from a Git repository.
You can also import Github files from a URL.
  Pros   Smart code completing  Large extensions library for a custom solution  Can push to a repository directly from the editor  Large user base and developer community   Cons   Interface and options may be intimidating for newer programmers  No built-in preview tool; only an extension  Reported performance issues occasionally   Operating Systems   Windows  Mac  Linux   Price  Visual Studio Code is free.
 10.
Edit+ : : Best for Beginner HTML Editing on Windows   G2 Rating : 4.4 out of 5 stars  Edit+ is a premium code editor for Microsoft Windows.
It supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, C/C++, ASP, Perl, VBScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails.
While other editors offer out-of-the-box support for more languages, Edit+ can be extended for other programming languages by submitting a custom syntax file.
 One thing I loved while testing out this tool was its HTML toolbar.
The toolbar looks just like the editing toolbar of a word processor, but the difference is that it inserts those tags instead.
You can easily bold, italicize, center, and otherwise format text with the mere click of a button, instead of needing to type out the tags.
You can also insert comments, special characters, tables, forms, divs, and more.
 For that reason, I recommend it especially if you’ll be editing a ton of HTML.
Edit+ makes it much easier to draft up code without needing to type anything manually — not even the start of a tag.
 With Edit+, you can upload your local files to an FTP server or edit remote files directly.
Other features include spell check, autocompletion, search and replace, customizable keyboard shortcuts, tabbed document interface, and window splitting.

 Access now     Learn more           Features   Dual text and HTML editor: If you’re looking for a text editor in addition to an HTML editor, Edit+ will do the job.
As with other tools, it’s simple enough to edit text, but complex enough to handle programming files.
 Built-in FTP : Edit+ includes a built-in FTP client that allows you to edit code live and transfer large files safely.
 HTML toolbar : With Edit+’s built-in toolbar, you can build HTML-based websites like you would writing a plain text document.
 Customizable keyboard shortcuts : One unique feature that could be useful is the ability to create custom shortcuts for streamlined editing.
But with the HTML toolbar, you might not even need shortcuts.
  Pros   Syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and a handful of common programming languages  Split-screen code editing  Customizable keyboard shortcuts  FTP integration   Cons   No way to change the editor’s theme colors  Lacks extensive customization of other options   Operating Systems   Windows 10/11   Price  Edit+ is available as a free version and a paid version, which starts at $35.
The exact price depends on the number of users that you need to buy a license for.
 CSS Editors  While most code editors offer CSS editing capabilities, you might want to use a specialized tool to create external and internal CSS stylesheets .
 Specialized CSS editors provide added support or extended features for working with CSS styles.
For instance, most code editors don’t include an in-app preview of CSS changes, but with the software options below, you can see your changes in real time.
 With that, let’s go over the best code editors you can use to power-up your CSS editing.
 1.
Adobe Dreamweaver   G2 Rating : 4.1 out of 5 stars  Adobe Dreamweaver is a web design software tool that allows you to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a live environment.
You can see your changes as you make them in the tool’s preview pane and save them automatically as you go.
This is not just a powerful CSS editing tool, but a great option for creating strong, responsive websites with visual helpers to guide you along the way.
 Adobe Dreamweaver includes a quick editor to help you rapidly change the declarations of a CSS class without needing to search the entire CSS stylesheet.
Here’s what that looks like in action:  Using the Quick Editor in Dreamweaver CC  Pros   Preview pane where you can see your changes  Visual aids to help prevent errors  Quick editor lets you edit CSS classes in a live environment   Cons   Complicated graphical user interface — not recommended for beginners  Subscription-based   Operating Systems   Mac  Windows   Price  Adobe Dreamweaver costs $20.99/month for a single-app subscription or $54.99 with a Creative Cloud subscription (with this option, you get access to all other Adobe CC apps, as well).
 2.
Pinegrow Web Editor   G2 Rating : 4.3 out of 5 stars  Pinegrow Web Editor is a visual website builder that allows you to edit CSS, SASS (a CSS-based language), Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap CSS in a live environment.
If you’ve worked with drag-and-drop page builders in the past, you’ll find the Pinegrow Web Editor simple and easy to use, only with the added customization and flexibility options that come with being able to edit your own code.
 Pinegrow Web Editor includes a powerful CSS editor that allows you to change active rules, inline styles, and CSS grids .
You can also quickly create rules without needing to access the stylesheet directly.
Here’s what that looks like in action:   Pros   Preview pane where you can see your changes  Support for multiple CSS languages and frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, SASS)  Editor lets you edit CSS classes in a live environment   Cons   No JavaScript support   Operating Systems   Mac  Windows  Linux   Price  Pinegrow Web Editor lets you choose between 3 payment options: a $99/year subscription, a $12/month subscription, or a $149 one-time fee.
Some features, such as the Tailwind Visual Editor, come at an additional fee.
 3.
Brackets   G2 Rating : 4.4 out of 5 stars  Brackets is a code editor for Windows and Mac that’s free to install and familiar to use for experienced programmers.
While it doesn’t offer a preview in the same pane as your CSS code, it still allows you to see your changes by connecting to your browser.
Most importantly, it’s free and open-source.
 Brackets is a top CSS editing tool because it allows you to edit existing rules and add new rules to any CSS class or element without needing to open your stylesheet.
You can do it straight in your HTML code.
Here’s what that feature looks like in action:     Pros   Ability to see your changes in a web browser  Free and open-source  Editor lets you edit CSS classes without opening your stylesheet   Cons   Not as beginner-friendly as other options   Operating Systems   Mac  Windows   Price  Brackets is free.
 Choosing Your Code Editor  Since a code editor can help you create and deploy code faster, it’s a must-have for your web development toolkit.
Instead of deciding what the "best" HTML and CSS editor is, pick the one with features and extensions that align with your needs.

Goto Definition, Goto Reference and Goto Symbol in Project also support side-by-side viewing.
Explore the full definition, not just a summary in a small popup.
  View Definitions in Auto Complete When an auto-complete word is a symbol with a definition, click the Definition link, or pressing F12 will open the definition to the right.

                        navigation easier and more intuitive than ever.
    Context-Aware Auto Complete  The auto complete engine has been rewritten to provide smart
                        completions based on existing code in a project.

        Build and extend in real-time with CSS variables  Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities.
We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere.
On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.
  Learn more about CSS variables       Using CSS variables  Use any of our global :root variables to write new styles.
CSS variables use the var(--bs-variableName) syntax and can be inherited by children elements.
 .component  {   color :  var ( -- bs-gray-800 );   background-color :  var ( -- bs-gray-100 );   border :  1 px  solid  var ( -- bs-gray-200 );   border-radius :  .25 rem ;  }   .component-header  {   color :  var ( -- bs-purple );  }    Customizing via CSS variables  Override global, component, or utility class variables to customize Bootstrap just how you like.
No need to redeclare each rule, just a new variable value.

Bootstrap is an open-source framework for quickly building responsive websites and mobile-first web projects.
Because it offers a collection of reusable code, you won’t have to build a site from scratch.
 To understand why over 21 million websites on the internet use Bootstrap , let’s take a closer look at what it is and how to use it.
 Table of Contents   What is Bootstrap CSS?
 How to Download Bootstrap CSS  Ho to Use Bootstrap CSS  Bootstrap CSS Examples  How to Override Bootstrap CSS       What is Bootstrap CSS?
  Bootstrap CSS is the leading CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
This free and open-source toolkit comes with a responsive grid system, global CSS settings, extensive pre-built components including buttons, navbars, and forms, and optional JavaScript plugins to speed up the development process.
    Though Bootstrap is an open-source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript , it is often referred to as a CSS framework.
 To understand why, you must first understand that CSS is generally easier to learn for people at all levels of technical experience and is faster in browsers than JavaScript.
For these reasons, Bootstrap developers wrote in CSS (and HTML ) over JavaScript whenever possible.
The CSS library included in Bootstrap is therefore much larger than the JavaScript library.
 Since Bootstrap makes it easier and faster to create responsive websites, it appeals to many front-end developers and beginners in particular.
However, it’s not recommended by all.
Below we’ll look at why Bootstrap is so popular and when it’s ideal to use — and when it’s not ideal.
 Why Bootstrap?
 Bootstrap is the go-to toolkit for many front-end developers.
According to W3Techs , it's used by 22.1% of all websites on the internet.
 There are a few factors driving Bootstrap’s popularity.
First and foremost, it’s open-source and therefore free to download and use.
It’s also fully customizable, and compatible with all modern browsers.
This is true of many CSS frameworks, however.
 What sets Bootstrap apart from other development toolkits is that it was developed mobile-first.
Meaning, the code was optimized for mobile devices (i.e. the smallest screen size) first and then scaled up to display on larger screens.
As a result, building with Bootstrap CSS ensures that your site supports proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices.
 Another reason Bootstrap is so popular is that it’s easy to use.
It comes bundled with templates for typography, forms , buttons, drop-down menus, navigation, and other interface components.
Using these pre-styled templates, you can add features that enrich the user experience on your site without having to code them from scratch.
 When to Use Bootstrap  There are many reasons to use Bootstrap.
We’ve discussed some above but let’s take a closer look at these reasons below.
 1.
You want a responsive website.
 Building a responsive site is much easier using Bootstrap than doing so from scratch.
Bootstrap comes with responsive styles, like containers and media queries, to ensure your site adjusts to the viewport.
That means you don’t have to worry about whether your visitors are using desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.
 2.
You want to save time.
 You can build your site quickly with Bootstrap.
Once you download the framework, you can get started with a basic template and then add the components you need.
These components are fundamental HTML elements, like tables, forms, buttons, images, and icons, that are styled with a base class and extended with modifier classes.
Using these pre-designed components significantly limits the amount of custom CSS you have to write.
 Consider Bootstrap buttons for example.
The base class .btn is used for all the common styles you want for your buttons, like display, padding, border-width.
With this class, you don’t have to keep repeating these CSS properties in your stylesheet to format every single button you add.
 Modifier classes, like .btn-primary on the other hand, are used to add the more specific styles you want for your buttons, like color, background-color, and border-color of your buttons.
This is just one example of how using Bootstrap components is much faster than coding them from scratch.
 3.
You’re familiar with HTML and CSS.
 Though Bootstrap does simplify the process of building a site, you’ll have to be familiar with HTML and CSS to use the framework.
For example, understanding the CSS box model will be important when using the container class and building your first Bootstrap grid.
 The good news is you’ll only need a basic knowledge of coding to get started.
 4.
You have multiple people building out your site.
 If you have multiple collaborators working on a site, then consistency is important.
You don’t want buttons on your homepage to look different from buttons on your landing page, or to use a different website typography on your blog than anywhere else on your site — and so on.
Using Bootstrap and its default settings, utility classes, and component elements can help ensure the front end of your site looks consistent.
 5.
You want to be part of a community.
 Since Bootstrap is open source, it has a global community of developers and designers dedicated to supporting the framework.
These developers and designers modify and enhance Bootstrap's codebase on GitHub .
They also answer questions on Twitter , Stack Overflow , and in a dedicated Slack room .
When using Bootstrap, you can leverage this active community to become a better Bootstrap user.
 When Not to Use Bootstrap  While there are many benefits of using this CSS framework, there are some reasons not to use Bootstrap as well.
Let’s take a closer look at these reasons below.
 1.
You want a unique website.
 Since Bootstrap comes with pre-styled content, components, and templates, Bootstrap sites tend to look the same out-of-the-box.
In fact, Bootstrap has been blamed for why websites today all look the same .
 You can customize a Bootstrap site, but it’ll take time.
Plus, if you have to override too much of the default styling, then it might make more sense to create your own stylesheet in the first place.
 2.
You want a theme.
 The Bootstrap framework is not a theme — though there are Bootstrap themes available.
Let’s compare the framework to a WordPress theme , for example.
 When you install and activate a WordPress theme , it changes your entire site’s appearance.
When you download the Bootstrap framework, aspects of your site’s appearance will change automatically, like the typography.
But you still have to write the HTML and plug in the preset layouts, colors, and components you need to make up your website.
 3.
You want a fast-loading site.
 Bootstrap can negatively impact the speed of your website.
Why?
Because it’s heavy — not in terms of KB, exactly, but in terms of how much the average user doesn’t use.
 Bootstrap is less than 500KB.
You can also take several steps to reduce that weight and mitigate its impact on load time.
For example, you can use the minified CSS and JavaScript files Or you only download the CSS files, not the JavaScript ones.
 But even with these steps, Bootstrap can still be too heavy for what you need.
Most users don’t need all the components, utilities, and plugins that Bootstrap comes with, so they might be weighing down your site even if they’re not being used.
 4.
You don’t have time to learn and read through the Bootstrap documentation.
 Bootstrap is considered an easy-to-use platform.
It offers extensive documentation for every part of its framework, from its layout to content to components and more.
That means virtually anyone can learn Bootstrap — it also means it will take time to read through the documentation and learn the framework.
If you are looking to build a website as quickly as possible, then Bootstrap might not be as ideal as other solutions, like website builders .
 5.
You want to master HTML and CSS.
 Using the pre-designed components and templates that Bootstrap provides makes it much easier and faster to build a website — but it can also stunt your growth as a coder.
Creating with Bootstrap is like using a calculator to do algebra: you can end up with the result you want without totally understanding how you got it.
That's why it's good to spend time creating your own custom components, even if you also learn and use Bootstrap.
 Now that we understand what Bootstrap CSS is and who should be using it, let’s briefly discuss the different download options you have.
  How to Download Bootstrap CSS  Before we walk through the process of downloading Bootstrap, it’s important to note that you can load Bootstrap remotely via BootstrapCDN or jsDelivr instead of downloading it.
This will require visitors to have an internet connection to visit your site and will require you to post more code, however.
As a result, downloading Bootstrap is the more popular choice.
 There are two different forms of Bootstrap available for download .
Each version — a precompiled and a source code version — appeal to different users depending on whether they prioritize ease-of-use or flexibility.
Let’s take a closer look at each below.
 Precompiled Bootstrap  The precompiled version is the most basic form of Bootstrap.
You’ll download precompiled CSS and JS files and minified CSS and JS files that are easy to drop in nearly any web project.
 Once downloaded, you’ll unzip the compressed folder and see the following structure.
 bootstrap/  ├── css/  │   ├── bootstrap-grid.css  │   ├── bootstrap-grid.css.map  │   ├── bootstrap-grid.min.css  │   ├── bootstrap-grid.min.css.map  │   ├── bootstrap-reboot.css  │   ├── bootstrap-reboot.css.map  │   ├── bootstrap-reboot.min.css  │   ├── bootstrap-reboot.min.css.map  │   ├── bootstrap.css  │   ├── bootstrap.css.map  │   ├── bootstrap.min.css  │   └── bootstrap.min.css.map  └── js/  ├── bootstrap.bundle.js  ├── bootstrap.bundle.js.map  ├── bootstrap.bundle.min.js  ├── bootstrap.bundle.min.js.map  ├── bootstrap.js  ├── bootstrap.js.map  ├── bootstrap.min.js  └── bootstrap.min.js.map  Using the compiled version is easier and faster to use than the source code version — but it’s more difficult to customize .
Any change you want to make to a pre-styled element or layout has to be applied with an override to the current styles.
 If you want to customize the CSS and JS files included in Bootstrap as you please, then you’ll be better off downloading the source code version.
 Bootstrap Source Code  The source code version includes the precompiled CSS, JS, and font assets as well as source files for the CSS, JS, and icon fonts respectively.
 If you choose to download the Bootstrap source code, then you’ll unzip the folder and see the following structure.
 bootstrap/  ├── dist/  │   ├── css/  │   └── js/  ├── site/  │   └──docs/  │      └── 4.6/  │          └── examples/  ├── js/  └── scss/  The dist/ folder contains everything listed in the precompiled section above.
The docs/ folder includes the source code for Bootstrap documentation and examples of Bootstrap usage.
The js/ folder contains the source code for Bootstrap JS and the scss/ folder for Bootstrap CSS.
 Since this version of Bootstrap requires you to have Autoprefixer and a SASS compiler, the set-up process is longer and more difficult than setting up the pre-compiled version.
Once set up, however, you can change and customize the files any way you want.
 Each version of Bootstrap is ideal for different use cases, but because the precompiled Bootstrap is simpler and faster to use, we’ll focus on that version for the rest of the post.
 Below let’s look at how you can use the precompiled Bootstrap to build a website.
     How to Use Bootstrap CSS   In order to use Bootstrap CSS, you need to integrate it into your development environment.
To do that, you simply need to create a folder on your computer.
In that folder, save your compiled CSS and JS files and a new HTML file where you’ll load Bootstrap.
Then you can use Bootstrap templates to add interface elements to the page.
     Let’s break down this process step-by-step.
 Loading Bootstrap CSS and JS  First, create a folder on your computer called “bootstrap.” Move the compiled CSS files from your Bootstrap download into that folder.
If you are also using the JS part of Bootstrap, move the compiled JS files into the folder as well.
 In that same folder, create another file and call it index.html.
Open this file with a text editor of your choice, like Notepad++ .
You can copy and paste the basic HTML template on Bootstrap’s official site into the file or code it from scratch.
 Below is an example of an HTML page coded from scratch.
  <html lang="en">
<head>   
<title>Bootstrap Tutorial Sample Page</title>  
  <meta charset="utf-8">  
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> 
</head>
<body></body>
</html>  You’re now ready to load Bootstrap CSS into your project.
Simply add the following line of code into the header of the index.html file, right before the </head> tag.
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">  If you plan to just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, then you’re all set.
 If you plan to use the JS part as well, then you need to add two more lines of code.
Components including alerts, toggle buttons, carousels , and dropdowns require the use of JavaScript to function so continue these steps if you want to add any of these elements to your site.
 First, you’ll need to load the jQuery library.
To do so, download jQuery onto your computer.
Unzip the file and save it in the “bootstrap” folder along with the compiled CSS and JS files and index.html file.
 You’ll then add the following line of code in the index.html file.
This time, you’ll add it to the footer, instead of the header, right after the <body> tag.
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>  To load Bootstrap JavaScript, add the following line of code right after the call for jQuery.
  <script src="bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>  Once you’ve completed these steps, this is what your index.html file should look like:   <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <title>Bootstrap Tutorial Sample Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>

<body>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</body>
</html>  Once you save the folder, you’ll have a basic Bootstrap layout that looks like this:   This can now function as the homepage of your site.
 Building a Basic Template  To continue building this page, you can add a navigation bar, header, footer, glyphicon font, favicon , and other interface components.
Let’s walk through adding one component — a navigation bar — step-by-step so you understand how to use Bootstrap.
 Say you want to add a Bootstrap navbar that looks something like this to the homepage:  Now a prospect can arrive on your homepage and immediately find out more about your company, the features of your product, and your pricing — or they can search something else.
 Below is the code for this Navbar example.
  <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarTogglerDemo02" aria-controls="navbarTogglerDemo02" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto mt-2 mt-lg-0">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <form class="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0">
      <input class="form-control mr-sm-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
      <button class="btn btn-outline-success my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</nav>  Let’s break this snippet down into its supported subcomponents: color scheme, brand, toggler, nav, and form.
 Color Scheme  Take a closer look at that first line of code.
See navbar-dark bg-dark ?
That calls for a dark background color.
If you prefer a light color scheme, replace with navbar-light bg-light.
It will look something like the following:  Or you can choose one of the other default colors .
 Brand  In that second line of code, see navbar-brand ?
That designates your company, product, or project name.
Simply replace “Navbar” before the </a> tag with the correct name.
 Toggler  Next, you’ll see a big chunk of code that denotes the toggle button.
This button is hidden on desktop.
It appears only on mobile, when the content of the navigation bar must be collapsed to fit the smaller screen.
 In the code above, the navbar-toggler style is defined so the brand name shows on the left of the mobile screen and the toggle button on the right.
Clicking on the button will reveal the collapsed content, as shown below.
  Nav  In the next bit of code, see navbar-nav ?
Using this subcomponent, you can add links in your navigation bar.
You just need to wrap the appropriate modifier class ( nav-link ) around the word you want to hyperlink.
 Form  You can also add a form, like a search box, in your navigation bar with the form-inline subcomponent.
You can see this bit of code at the bottom of the template above.
 Now that you know how to add Bootstrap’s responsive navigation header with branding, navigation, and more, you can follow a similar process to add other elements to the page.
Let’s take a look at a few of those below.
  Bootstrap CSS Examples  Bootstrap offers HTML and CSS templates, or “examples,” to help you start building your site quickly.
While Bootstrap Source Code comes with more advanced examples with custom components and layouts that add onto the framework, we’re going to focus on examples that use built-in components available in both the precompiled and source code versions.
 We’ve already touched on a few examples above, including the Navbar.
Below we’ll take a closer look at a few additional examples.
 Bootstrap Grid  CSS grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house content.
In the Bootstrap grid system, rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper positioning and padding .
These rows are used to create horizontal groups of columns.
 Since Bootstrap is a 12-column system, you’ll have to specify the number of twelve available columns you wish to span.
Say you’d like to create three equal-width columns that are centered on the page across devices at any size.
Then you need three “four-of-twelve” columns, as represented by the .col-4 class.
Below is the grid example in full.
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>  On the front-end of your site, it would look like this on mobile and desktop.
  But what if you want the grid to appear one way on desktop and another way on mobile?
Let’s say you want the columns to appear side-by-side on desktop, but stack on top of each other on mobile.
 Then you can specify the width of the columns with the prefix for “small.” This would make the columns 100% wide until the small breakpoint (576px).
Below is the grid example in full.
  <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>  The video below shows how it would look on desktop and then change on mobile.
  Image Source  There are many more options you can play around with.
Using Bootstrap’s grid system, you can create equal-width columns that span multiple lines.
You can set the width of one column and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it.
You can size columns based on the natural width of their content — and much more.
 Bootstrap Alerts  You can add alerts to your Bootstrap site to provide important messages to your visitors.
Bootstrap offers eight default colors for alert messages.
Let’s say you want to add an alert to indicate that a visitor has successfully created an account, for example.
Then you can use the example below.
  <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  A simple success alert—check it out!
</div>  It will look like this on the front-end of your site.
  If you’ve loaded the compiled JS onto your site, you can also add a dismiss button to let visitors close the alert once they’ve read it.
 Bootstrap Buttons  With Bootstrap, you can choose from several predefined button styles to quickly add buttons to landing pages or forms on your Bootstrap site .
Let’s say you want to add an “info” button to your site.
Below is the example and how it would look on the front end.
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Info</button>   While the .btn classes are designed to be used with the <button> element, you can use them on other elements as well.
If you’d like to turn a link into a button, for example, then you can use the code below:   <a href="#" class="btn btn-info" role="button">Link Button</a>  Let’s say I wanted to add a button to my Bootstrap site that encourages visitors to learn more about CSS animation , for example.
Then I could link the button to a blog post on the topic.
Here would be the code:   <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation" class="btn btn-info" role="button">Learn More</a>  And here is how it would function on the site:   Image Source  You can change the color, size, and other aspects of your button by adding the appropriate modifier classes.
 Bootstrap Carousels  A carousel is a slideshow for presenting a series of content, whether that's images, text, or custom markup.
In web design, you can create a pure CSS carousel without JavaScript — or you can use Bootstrap to create one.
In Bootstrap, carousels are built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript.
Using a Bootstrap example, like the one below, can significantly speed up the coding process.
 This example is a carousel with slides only and the previous and next controls.
  <div id="SimpleCarouselExample" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
    </div>
  </div>
  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleControls" role="button" data-slide="next">
  <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>

  </a>
</div>  Here is how it would look on the front end of your site:  You can walk through the development process step-by-step in How to Create a Carousel Slider for Your Website in Bootstrap CSS .
 Once you’re satisfied with the layout of your web page, you may want to customize the appearance of these and other Bootstrap components by changing their colors, font size , borders, or other existing Bootstrap styles.
To do so, you can override the existing styles.
Let’s look at how below.
    How to Override Bootstrap CSS   Changing the default styling of Bootstrap CSS is simple.
Create a file with your text editor and call it main.css.
Here, add any custom CSS changes you want to make.
Once you’re done, save this file in the same folder as your Bootstrap CSS and JS files and index.html file.
Then, you just need to add one line of code to the header of your index.html file.
    Remember how you added the following line of code into the header of the index.html file to load Bootstrap CSS on your site?
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">  Right below this, paste the following code:   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom.css">  This will ensure that whatever CSS you add in the custom.css file overrides the default styles in the index.html file.
 The structure of your index.html file should now look like this:   <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Bootstrap Tutorial Sample Page</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom.css">
</head>
  
<body>
  <script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>

</html>  It’s important to note that this process of overriding the default CSS styles can work for both the precompiled version of Bootstrap and the source code version.
With the latter however, you can also directly edit the Bootstrap SASS source code if you have experience with SASS.
 Since many users don’t know SASS, let’s look at an example of editing the precompiled Bootstrap.
 We’ll start with a simple layout created by developer and technical writer Tania Rascia .
Building off the basic HTML template provided by Bootstrap, she added a navigation bar, jumbotron header, grid, and glyphicons using the templates bundled in the framework.
The result is shown below.
  Image Source  The page is clean, responsive, and cross-browser friendly, but rather austere.
To personalize the design, Rascia added custom CSS to the custom.css file.
By using CSS selectors , she was able to apply unique style properties to the HTML elements on her page.
 First, she wanted to remove the white space between the navbar and the jumbotron header.
So she added the following code to the file using the class selector "navbar."   .navbar {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}  She also wanted to change the color of the jumbotron to green and the color of the font to white and center the text.
She therefore added the following code to the file using the class selector "jumbotron."   .jumbotron {
  background: #27a967;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
.jumbotron p {
  color: white;
  font-size: 26px;
}  She made several other changes as well.
Rather than go through them one-by-one, I’ll just copy and paste the contents of her custom.css file below.
You'll notice a mix of type selectors and class selectors are used.
  body {
  background: #3E4649;
  color: #f7f7f7;
  font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}
h1, h2 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #cdcdcd;
}
.navbar {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
.jumbotron {
  background: #27A967;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
.jumbotron p {
  color: white;
  font-size: 26px;
}
.navbar-inverse {
  background: #2E2F31;
  border: 0;
}
.dropdown-menu {
  background: #2E2F31;
  border-radius: 0;
  border: 0;
}
.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav li a {
  color: #f7f7f7;
  font-size: 16px;
}
.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav li a:hover {
  background: #27a967;
}

.navbar-inverse .navbar-nav .dropdown-menu li a:hover {
  background: #2c463c;
}

.dropdown-menu li a {
  padding: 10px;
}

.btn-primary {
  color: #fff;
  background-color: transparent;
  border-color: white;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  color: #27a967;
  background-color: white;
  border-color: white;
}

.glyphicon-large {
  font-size: 100px;
}

.call-to-action {
  text-align: center;
}

.call-to-action p {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}  With these changes, she’s completely transformed her Bootstrap website.

They draw the visitor’s eye and help them take action on your website.
  Knowing the importance of this element, the CSS framework Bootstrap provides ready-made templates for buttons.
These templates allow you to quickly and easily create and customize buttons on your Bootstrap site.
You’ll just need to have some technical knowledge of HTML and CSS to do so.
  In this post, you’ll learn how to create buttons with Bootstrap, what the button classes are, and what styles are possible with Bootstrap.
 How to Create a Button in Bootstrap  Creating a button in Bootstrap is easy thanks to the predesigned templates.
You can simply copy and paste the code of any of the predefined styles (shown below) into the body section of your HTML file to add buttons to your site.
  Image Source  You’re not limited to these default options, however.
Bootstrap supports multiple colors, sizes, and states so you can change the appearance and behavior of your buttons.
 To understand how to change the appearance and behavior of Bootstrap buttons, we first have to understand button classes.
 Bootstrap Button Classes  The Bootstrap button class is .btn .
Using this button class with a <button> element will create an unformatted button.
 See the Pen bootstrap button by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  To make the button more visible (and clickable!) to visitors, you can add modifier classes.
 Bootstrap buttons have nine default modifier classes, each with different use cases.
Let's take a closer look at these default modifier classes below.
 .btn-primary  The .btn-primary class can be used to provide more visual weight to a button while representing a primary action for visitors to take on the page.
For example, on a business site's homepage, the primary button might invite visitors to purchase their product.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - primary by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-secondary  The .btn-secondary class can be used to provide more visual weight to a button while representing a secondary action for visitors to take on the page.
 While a primary button might invite visitors to purchase a product on a business site's homepage, the secondary button might invite visitors to demo it.
Here’s an example of the two classes together.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - secondary by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-success  The .btn-success class can be used to indicate a successful or positive action.
For example, at the end of a form, the success button can encourage visitors to submit.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - success by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-danger  The “danger” class can be used to indicate a potentially dangerous or negative action.
 While the success button can encourage visitors to submit a form, you might want to use a danger button instead to ensure visitors review their information before submitting.
This is especially important if they can't go back and change their information once they submit.
 Here’s an example of the .btn-success and .btn-danger classes side-by-side.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - danger by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-warning  Similarly, the .btn-warning class can represent a warning.
For example, if a user is creating an account, the warning button can indicate that some required fields were missed and must be filled in before continuing with registration.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - warning by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-info  The .btn-info class can represent an informational alert.
For example, on an account registration form, an info button might indicate that a user can click to edit their profile.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - info by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-light  The .btn-light class is a great option for web pages with dark background colors.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - light by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-dark  The .btn-dark class works well for web pages with light background colors.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - dark by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  .btn-link  You can use the .btn-link class if you’re looking to deemphasize the appearance of a button.
It will make a button look like a link but still behave like a button.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - link by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  For more customization options, you can either replace these default modifier classes or combine them with other CSS classes for additional color, size, and state options.
 Before we take a closer look at these style options, it’s important to note that .btn classes can be used with other elements in Bootstrap.
 How to Use Bootstrap Button Classes with Other Elements  While Bootstrap’s button classes are designed to be used with the <button> element, they can also be used on <a> or <input> elements.
That means you can use button classes to link to new pages or sections within a current page.
 You can also button classes on <a> elements to collapse content or otherwise trigger on-page functionality.
In that case, these links should be given a role="button" to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen readers, as shown below.
 In addition to showing a button class being used with an <a> element, the following example includes button classes being used with the <button> and <input> element.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - using classes with other elements by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Now that we understand how button classes work on <button> , <a> , and <input> elements, let’s take a look at the different button styles you can use on your Bootstrap site.
 Bootstrap Button Styles  As mentioned earlier, you can create new styles for your Bootstrap buttons by replacing any of the nine default modifier classes or by combining them with other classes.
Both methods will enable you to create buttons in additional colors, sizes, and states.
 Let’s take a closer look at these button design options below.
 Bootstrap Button Colors  Using a default modifier class will change the color of the text and background color of your button.
.btn-danger will make the button red and font white, .
btn-warning will make the button yellow and font black, and so on.
 But, say you want to apply a different text and background color to your buttons.
You can do this by using the .btn class in your HTML and a class selector in your CSS.
 Say you want to make the background color of your button purple and the text white.
Then you’d use the CSS selector  .btn , paired with declarations that change the text and background colors.
See the example below:  See the Pen bootstrap button - unsing bootstrap with other elements by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  To learn more about overriding Bootstrap's default styling, check out our post How to Edit, Customize, and Override Bootstrap CSS .
 Bootstrap Outline Buttons  If you prefer your buttons to have colored outlines instead of colored backgrounds, use the modifier class .btn-outline .
The same default options for button colors are available for outline buttons, as shown below.
No CSS is required to use any of these styles.
  Image Source  If you’re looking for more design options, you can change the outline color to any color you want using the same method as outlined above.
Just use the class .btn btn-outline in your HTML instead of .btn and the CSS style property border-color instead of background-color .
 See the Pen bootstrap button - outline by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Bootstrap Button Size  You can also control the size of your buttons with the modifier class .btn-lg or .btn-sm .
 See the Pen bootstrap button - button sizes by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Bootstrap Button States  To change your button’s state, use the class .
active to make the button look like it’s been pressed.
It will have a darker background, darker border, and inset shadow.
 For the opposite effect, use the disabled attribute to make a button look like it can’t be pressed.
Note that disabled is an attribute, not a class.
 It’s also important to note that <a> elements do not support the disabled attribute.
You’ll have to use the .disabled class to make <a> elements appear inactive.
Since the .disabled class disables the link functionality of <a> elements, these modified elements will not only appear unclickable — they will be unclickable.
 See the Pen bootstrap button - states by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Bootstrap Toggle Buttons  To create a Bootstrap button that switches from its default state to an active state when a visitor clicks on it, you can add data-toggle="button" after your .btn class.
Once clicked, this button will retain its darker background, darker border, and inset shadow.
(The inset shadow does disappear when the visitor clicks elsewhere on the page.)  See the Pen bootstrap button - toggle by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Bootstrap Radio Buttons  Radio buttons are usually presented in groups.
Within a group of radio buttons, only one button can be selected at a time.
Selecting a button will automatically deselect the currently selected button.
 The HTML code for this is a little trickier than the other examples, so we’ll go through it step-by-step.
 The syntax of a radio button is <input type="radio"> .
Let’s insert that code three times to create a group of three.
Each button has to share the same name attribute, so we’ll add name=”options” to the same line.
And since we may want to apply different styles to each <input> element, we’ll give each its own ID.
 Here’s what we have so far:   <input type="radio" name="options" id="option1"> Radio
<input type="radio" name="options" id="option2"> Radio
<input type="radio" name="options" id="option3"> Radio   To apply button styles to these <input> elements in Bootstrap, we have to nest them in <label> tags and add .btn classes.
In this example, we’ll add the .btn-secondary modifier class.
Now we’ve got this:   <label class="btn btn-secondary">
<input type="radio" name="options" id="option1"> Radio
</label>
<label class="btn btn-secondary">
<input type="radio" name="options" id="option2"> Radio
</label>
<label class="btn btn-secondary">
<input type="radio" name="options" id="option3"> Radio
</label>   Finally, we just have to wrap all of this in a <div> and apply the classes .btn-group , .btn-group-toggle , and data-toggle=”buttons” to ensure that each button in the group toggles from its default state to an active state when clicked.
Here’s the final code:  See the Pen bootstrap button - radio by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
  Add buttons to your Bootstrap site.
 When designed and placed well, buttons can help persuade visitors to take action.
Any of the button types described above can be re-created and customized to your unique Bootstrap site.
You’ll just need some familiarity with HTML and CSS to get started.

  How you add this interactive element to your website depends on how you build your site.
If you were creating a website on WordPress , for example, then you could install a plugin — like the HubSpot WordPress plugin — to add forms to your site.
If you were creating a website with the CSS framework Bootstrap , on the other hand, then you could use CSS classes to quickly add forms on your site.
 We’ll cover this process in detail in this post.
Then, we'll walk through common styles and examples of Bootstrap forms .
Let’s get started.
  Bootstrap Form CSS  Thanks to the predesigned templates included in Bootstrap, creating forms for your site is easy.
 You’ll just need to add the necessary code into the body section of your index.html file.
Say, for example, you want to add a form to capture a customer’s account information so they can log into your site faster and easier next time.
It might look something like this:   Image Source  Here’s the code you’d use:   <form>
  <div class="mb-3">
  	<label for="exampleInputEmail1" class="form-label">Email address</label>
  	<input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp">
  </div>
  <div class="mb-3">
  	<label for="exampleInputPassword1" class="form-label">Password</label>
  	<input type="password" class="form-control" id="exampleInputPassword1">
  </div>
  <div class="mb-3 form-check">
  	<input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="exampleCheck1">
  	<label class="form-check-label" for="exampleCheck1">Remember Me</label>
  </div>
<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>  Notice that you have the opening and closing tags for a <form> element.
And, within those tags, you have a variety of HTML elements , including dividers, labels, inputs, and buttons, that all together make up the form.
For these to work, they need to be styled with the correct form classes in Bootstrap.
 We can see a few of these in action in the three containers of the snippet above.
Let’s break down the elements and styling used in each.
 Form Controls  See the first two <input> elements?
These are styled with the .form-control class so that they span the entire width of the page and are responsive.
On the front-end, these are where the user will enter in their email address and password.
 Form Labels  These <input> elements are preceded by <label> elements so the user knows what information to enter in and to which box.
In Bootstrap 5, the latest version of Bootstrap, form labels require the .form-label class.
 Margin Utilities  Together, each <label> and <input> pair are wrapped in their own container, or <div> element, which is styled with the margin-bottom utility .mb-3.
 Margin utilities provide basic grouping of form labels, controls, text, and validation messaging, so they're a great way to add structure to forms.
 Form Checks  The third container is styled with the .mb-3 class as well as the .form-check class because it contains a checkbox.
To create this checkbox, the <input> element is styled with the .form-check-input class (instead of the .form-control class applied to the other <input> elements).
Lastly, the <label> element comes after the <input> element and is styled with the .form-check-label class.
 Button  Finally, there’s a button element included.
This requires styling with the button class rather than a form class.
 Now that we understand how to build a basic form in Bootstrap, let’s look at how else you can modify and extend the form class.
We'll start with a basic overview of the different styles Bootstrap offers, then walk through examples.
  Bootstrap Form Styles  You can use any of the predefined form styles, as shown in Bootstrap’s documentation , to quickly add forms on your site.
Let's take a brief look at the most common styles below.
 Bootstrap Select Form  The Bootstrap select form includes a drop down menu with a range of options.
Users can select one of these options.
It requires the .form-control class.
  Bootstrap Text Area Form  The Bootstrap text area form includes a text area where users can input comments or reviews.
A text area can contain an unlimited number of characters — unless a limit is set.
It requires the .form-control class.
  Bootstrap Attachment Form  The Bootstrap attachment or file input form allows users to choose and upload a file.
It requires the .form-control-file class.
  Bootstrap Grid Form  The Bootstrap grid form is any form that has multiple columns, varied widths, and other alignment options.
It requires the .row and .col classes.
  Bootstrap Address Form  The Bootstrap address form is an example of a complex form built using Bootstrap grid classes.
The .row class is used to form groups and the .col-*-* classes used to specify the width of the labels and controls so that the city, state, and zip are all on a single horizontal row.
  Bootstrap Horizontal Form  The Bootstrap horizontal form displays labels and their associated form controls on the same horizontal rows.
Like the address form style, it requires the .row class and  .col-*-* classes.
The .col-form-label class is also used to ensure the labels are vertically centered with their associated form controls.
  Bootstrap Inline Form  The Bootstrap inline form displays a series of labels, form controls, and buttons on a single horizontal row.
It requires the .row-cols-* classes.
(Note that the .form-inline class has been deprecated in Bootstrap 5.)   Bootstrap Form Validation  The Bootstrap validation form provides valuable, actionable feedback to users, typically after they try to submit a form.
This form style typically uses custom colors, borders, focus styles, and background icons to communicate feedback.
It requires the .{valid|invalid}-feedback classes.
  Bootstrap Range Input Form  The Bootstrap range input form allows users to horizontally scroll range inputs.
It requires the .form-range class as well as the input type attribute be set to “range.”   Bootstrap Checkbox Form  The Bootstrap checkbox form allows users to select one or several options in a list.
It requires the .form-check class as well as the input type attribute be set to “checkbox.”   Bootstrap Radio Form  The Bootstrap radio button form allows users to select only one option in a list.
It requires the .form-check class as well as the input type attribute be set to “radio.”   Bootstrap Floating Labels Form  A new style in Bootstrap 5, the Bootstrap floating labels form has labels that float over your input fields when a value has already been defined.
It requires a pair of <input class="form-control"> and <label> elements to be wrapped in the .form-floating class.
   Bootstrap Form CSS Examples  Below are some examples that demonstrate the range of Bootstrap’s form styles.
Each example will show the different required classes, form layouts, and more.
 I’ll be using the CodePen Editor to create the examples so you can click any of the Source links to view the full code snippet behind the example.
 1.
Bootstrap Select Example  Best for: Adding a dropdown menu for users to select one of multiple options  Let’s say you want to add a dropdown menu in your existing form to learn how users hear about your brand.
Then you’d add the following code in your HTML, right before the <div> containing the checkbox.
 This code snippet contains two divs wrapped in the .mb-3 utility class.
The first <div> contains a label for the dropdown menu.
The second div contains the <select> element with the .form-select class.
  <div class="mb-3">
  <label for="Default select example" class="form-label">How did you hear about us?</label>
</div>
<div class="mb-3">
  <select class="form-select" aria-label="Default select example">
  	<option selected>Select One</option>
  	<option value="1">Ad</option>
  	<option value="2">Friend</option>
  	<option value="3">Blog</option>
  </select>
</div>  Here’s the result:   Image Source  You can learn more about creating dropdown menus in forms, navigation menus, and other parts of your site in How to Create an HTML Dropdown Menu [+ Examples] .
 2.
Bootstrap Text Area Example  Best for: Asking an open-ended question  Let’s say you want to ask the user the same question, “How did you hear about us?” But rather than offer a limited selection of answers, you want to include a text area so they can write whatever they want.
 Then you’d add the following in your HTML, right before the <div> containing the checkbox.
Notice this code snippet contains a <label> element styled with the .form-label class and <textarea> element styled with the .form-control class.
Both are wrapped in a <div> element with the .mb-3 class.
  <div class="mb-3">
  <label for="exampleFormControlTextarea1" class="form-label">How did you hear about us?</label>
  <textarea class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlTextarea1" rows="3"></textarea>
</div>  Here’s the result:   Image Source  3.
Bootstrap Attachment Example  Best for: Asking users to upload a file  If you’d like to let users upload a file before submitting a form, then you can use an <input> element and style it with the .form-control class.
You’ll pair it with a <label> element and wrap it in a <div> styled with the .mb-3 class as usual.
 Here’s the code you’d add right before the button:   <div class="mb-3">
  <label for="exampleFormControlFile1" class="form-label">Upload Resume and Cover Letter</label>
  <input type="file" class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlFile1">
</div>  Here’s the result:   Image Source  4.
Bootstrap Grid Form Example  Best for: Creating forms with multiple columns, varied widths, and additional alignment options  To build more complex forms, you can use Bootstrap’s grid classes.
For example, say you want the input fields for email address and password to be side-by-side and the rest of the elements to be stacked vertically.
You also want to remove the labels above the input fields and instead have that text inside the fields.
 Then you can replace the first two <div> containers with three divs.
The first will be style with the .row class.
It will contain two divs, each of which is styled with the .col class and has a placeholder attribute.
  <div class="row">
<div class="col">
  <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Email address">
</div>
<div class="col">
  <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Password">
</div>
</div>  Here’s the result:   Image Source  Please note : I added some margin settings in the CSS to make the layout look better.
You can see that code by clicking on the source link.
 5.
Bootstrap Address Form Example  Best for: Creating forms with a different number of columns per row  You can create an even more complex layout with the Bootstrap’s grid classes than the layout above.
For example, say you want the input fields for email address and password to be side-by-side.
Then you want two address fields stacked vertically and the city, state, and zip fields on the same row.
 First, you want to style the <form> element with the .row class and a gutter modifier class.
Use the .g-3 class to set the horizontal and vertical gutter widths, or padding between columns.
 Since Bootstrap is a 12-column system, you’ll have to specify the number of twelve available columns you want each input to span.
So to put the email and password inputs in two equal-width columns, you'd use the .col-md-6 class.
The next two divs — for address and address 2 — will need a .col-12 class because they each take up an entire horizontal row.
For the final row, you want the city input to be the same size as the email and password inputs.
You want the state input to be two-thirds that size and the zip to be half that.
So you'd use the .col-md-6 for city, .col-md-4 for state, and .col-md-2 for zip (6 + 4 + 2 = 12).
 Here's the code all together:   <form class="row g-3">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <label for="inputEmail4" class="form-label">Email</label>
    <input type="email" class="form-control" id="inputEmail4">
  </div>
  
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <label for="inputPassword4" class="form-label">Password</label>
    <input type="password" class="form-control" id="inputPassword4">
  </div>
  
  <div class="col-12">
    <label for="inputAddress" class="form-label">Address</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="inputAddress" placeholder="1234 Main St">
  </div>

  <div class="col-12">
    <label for="inputAddress2" class="form-label">Address 2</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="inputAddress2" placeholder="Apartment, studio, or floor">
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <label for="inputCity" class="form-label">City</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="inputCity">
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <label for="inputState" class="form-label">State</label>
    <select id="inputState" class="form-select">
      <option selected>Choose...</option>
      <option>...</option>
    </select>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-2">
    <label for="inputZip" class="form-label">Zip</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="inputZip">
  </div>

  <div class="col-12">
    <div class="form-check">
      <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" id="gridCheck">
      <label class="form-check-label" for="gridCheck">Remember me</label>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="col-12">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>  Here's the result:   Image Source  6.
Bootstrap Horizontal Form Example  Best for: Placing labels next to their respective fields  You can also display labels and their associated form controls on the same horizontal rows, instead of stacked on top of each other.
 To do so, you'd apply the .row classes to the parent divs.
Then you'd apply the .col-sm-2 classes to the label elements and the .col-sm-10 classes to the div elements containing input elements.
You'd also apply the .col-form-label classes to the label elements to ensure they're vertically centered with their associated form controls.
 Here's the code all together:   <form>
  <div class="row mb-3">
    <label for="inputEmail3" class="col-sm-2 col-form-label">Email</label>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <input type="email" class="form-control" id="inputEmail3">
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row mb-3">
    <label for="inputPassword3" class="col-sm-2 col-form-label">Password</label>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <input type="password" class="form-control" id="inputPassword3">
    </div>
  </div>

  <fieldset class="row mb-3">
    <legend class="col-form-label col-sm-2 pt-0">Radios</legend>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
      <div class="form-check">
        <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="gridRadios" id="gridRadios1" value="option1" checked>
        <label class="form-check-label" for="gridRadios1">
          First radio
        </label>
      </div>
      <div class="form-check">
        <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="gridRadios" id="gridRadios2" value="option2">
        <label class="form-check-label" for="gridRadios2">
          Second radio
        </label>
      </div>

      <div class="form-check disabled">
        <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="gridRadios" id="gridRadios3" value="option3" disabled>
        <label class="form-check-label" for="gridRadios3">
          Third disabled radio
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
  </fieldset>

  <div class="row mb-3">
    <div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-2">
      <div class="form-check">
        <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" id="gridCheck1">
        <label class="form-check-label" for="gridCheck1">
          Example checkbox
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Sign in</button>
</form>  Here's the result:   Image Source  7.
Bootstrap Inline Form Example  Best for: Creating forms for smaller screen sizes  If you’re looking to take up less space, then you might want to create an inline form in which all of the elements are on one line.
You can do this by using the .row-cols-* classes.
 In the code snippet below, the <form> element is styled with the .row and .row-cols-auto classes, which gives the columns their natural width.
The .g-3 class is included to set the horizontal gutter widths and the .align-items-center class to align the form elements to the middle.
 Here’s the code:   <form class="row row-cols-auto g-3 align-items-center">

  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="inlineFormInputEmail1" class="visually-hidden">Email address</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="inlineFormInputEmail1" placeholder="Email Address">
  </div>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="inlineFormInputPassword1" class="visually-hidden">Password</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="inlineFormInputPassword1" placeholder="Password">
  </div>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <div class="form-check">
      <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="exampleCheck1">
      <label class="form-check-label" for="exampleCheck1">Remember me </label>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
  </div>
</form>  Here’s the result:   Image Source  8.
Bootstrap Form Validation Example  Best for: Providing feedback to users as they fill out a form  Let’s say you want to include actionable feedback to users filling out your forms, like a reminder to check the “Remember me” box if they forgot before submitting.
You can do so by applying validation classes to the Bootstrap <form> element.
 For example, the .was-validated class will let users know what fields must be filled out or checked off before submitting, whereas the .needs-validation class will only let users know if fields are missing after they try to submit.
 Whichever class you use, input fields that have been filled out will have a green border, while input fields that haven’t been filled out will have a red border.
If you’d like to tell users exactly what information is missing (and what info has been successfully provided), then you can even add .valid-feedback and .invalid-feedback messages.
 In the example below, let’s use the .needs-validation class so that the user will know if anything is missing.
 Here’s the HTML you’ll need to add in the <body> of your HTML.
  <form class="needs-validation" novalidate>
  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="validationCustom01" class="form-label">Email Address</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="validationCustom01" placeholder="Enter email address" required>
    <div class="valid-feedback">
      Thanks for entering a valid email address.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="validationCustom02" class="form-label">Password</label>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" id="validationCustom02" placeholder="Enter password" required>
    <div class="valid-feedback">
      Thanks for entering a valid password.
    </div>
</div>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <div class="form-check">
      <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="invalidCheck" required>
      <label class="form-check-label" for="invalidCheck">
        Remember me
      </label>
      <div class="invalid-feedback">
        Please check this box to continue.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="col-12">
    <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Submit form</button>
  </div>
</form>  And here's the starter JavaScript you’ll need to add below that in the <body> of your HTML.
  // Example starter JavaScript for disabling form submissions if there are invalid fields

(function () {
  "use strict";

  // Fetch all the forms we want to apply custom Bootstrap validation styles to

  var forms = document.querySelectorAll(".needs-validation");

  // Loop over them and prevent submission

  Array.prototype.slice
    .call(forms)

    .forEach(function (form) {
      form.addEventListener(
        "submit",
        function (event) {
          if (!form.checkValidity()) {
            event.preventDefault();

            event.stopPropagation();
          }

          form.classList.add("was-validated");
        },
        false
      );
    });
})();  Here’s the result:  Image Source  9.
Bootstrap Help Text Form Example  Best for: Providing directions proactively to users before they fill out a form  Another way to provide actionable feedback to users filling out your forms is to include help text.
 For example, you might explicitly state password requirements below the password input field, or next to it.
You can do so by applying the .form-text class to a block-level or inline element.
 Make sure to include an aria-describedby attribute so that assistive technologies, like screen readers, can understand and read the help text to users.
 Here's the code you'd add after the email address input and before the checkbox:   <div class="mb-3">
  	<label for="inputPassword5" class="form-label">Password</label>
  <input type="password" id="inputPassword5" class="form-control" aria-describedby="passwordHelpBlock">
  <small id="passwordHelpBlock" class="form-text">
  Your password must be 8-20 characters long, contain letters and numbers, and must not contain spaces, special 	   characters, or emoji.
  </small>
</div>  Here's the result:   Image Source  10.
Bootstrap Disabled Form Example  Best for: Preventing user interactions with a question or section of a form  Let’s say you want to disable an option or section of your form to make it unclickable and unusable.
You can add the disabled boolean attribute on an individual input to prevent user interactions and make it appear lighter, or you can add it to a <fieldset> element to specify that the group of related form elements is disabled.
 Here's the code for a disabled fieldset:   <fieldset disabled>
  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="disabledTextInput" class="form-label">Disabled input</label>
    <input type="text" id="disabledTextInput" class="form-control" placeholder="Disabled input">
  </div>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <label for="disabledSelect" class="form-label">Disabled select menu</label>
    <select id="disabledSelect" class="form-control">
      <option>Disabled select</option>
    </select>
  </div>
  
  <div class="mb-3">
    <div class="form-check">
      <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" id="disabledFieldsetCheck" disabled>
      <label class="form-check-label" for="disabledFieldsetCheck">
        Can't check this
      </label>
    </div>
  </div>

  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</fieldset>  Here's the result:   Image Source  11.
Bootstrap Checkbox and Radio Form Example  Best for: Asking users to select either one or several options in a list  You can achieve more user interaction in your forms by adding interactive elements like checkboxes and radio buttons .
Let’s say you want to provide users with a simple yes-or-no option like “remember me.” Then you could include a checkbox.
Users can choose one or no option.
Radio buttons, on the other hand, let users select exactly one option per group.
 Both checkboxes and radio buttons require the .form-check class.
They must also have their <input> elements styled with the .form-check-input class and their type attributes set to “checkbox” and “radio,” respectively.
 The code below will create three radio buttons in a horizontal layout and a checkbox element.
  <fieldset class="row mb-3">
  <legend class="col-form-label col-sm-2 pt-0">Radios</legend>

  <div class="col-sm-10">
    <div class="form-check">
      <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="gridRadios" id="gridRadios1" value="option1" checked>
      <label class="form-check-label" for="gridRadios1">
        First radio
      </label>
    </div>

    <div class="form-check">
      <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="gridRadios" id="gridRadios2" value="option2">
      <label class="form-check-label" for="gridRadios2">
        Second radio
      </label>
    </div>

    <div class="form-check disabled">
      <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="gridRadios" id="gridRadios3" value="option3" disabled>
      <label class="form-check-label" for="gridRadios3">
        Third disabled radio
      </label>
    </div>
  </div>
</fieldset>

<div class="mb-3 form-check">
  <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="exampleCheck1">
  <label class="form-check-label" for="exampleCheck1">Remember me </label>
</div>  Here's the result:   Image Source  12.
Bootstrap Floating Labels Form Example  Best for: Providing context to users as they fill out the form  Some Bootstrap forms, like the inline form example above, have placeholder text instead of labels.
This placeholder text disappears as the user begins typing in an input field.
 Let’s say you want to create form labels that float over these input fields as the user fills them in, instead of disappearing.
That way, a user always knows what information they’re being asked for and can easily review their completed form before submitting.
 To achieve this effect, wrap a pair of <input> and <label> elements in a div with the .form-floating class.
The input element must come first, and have the .form-control class and a placeholder attribute.
 Here’s the code all together:   <div class="form-floating mb-3">
  <input type="email" class="form-control" id="floatingInput" placeholder="name@example.com">
  <label for="floatingInput">Email address</label>
</div>
<div class="form-floating">
  <input type="password" class="form-control" id="floatingPassword" placeholder="Password">
  <label for="floatingPassword">Password</label>
</div>  Here’s the result:   Image Source  Adding Forms to Your Bootstrap Site  Web forms are an important design element for your website.
They can enable you to generate newsletter signups, accept orders online, and keep track of both customers’ and potential customers’ information.
 If you’re using Bootstrap, then you can use the templates above to create different forms with less code and in less time.
You just need to be familiar with HTML and CSS.

That’s because this open-source toolkit provides pre-designed templates and components so you can create layouts with important design elements like Bootstrap buttons , tables , and forms without having to build them from scratch.
  The process isn’t as simple as copying and pasting these chunks of reusable code, however.
You’ll want to customize Bootstrap templates and components to ensure your website reflects your unique branding.
  For example, you may want to add a custom color rather than use the 10 color utility classes that Bootstrap provides.
Or you may want to change the breakpoints of the Bootstrap grid layout.
Or you may want to add custom classes like a .btn-custom class to create completely unique buttons.

  How to Override Bootstrap Using CSS   How to Customize Bootstrap Buttons    How to Override Bootstrap Using Sass   How to Customize Bootstrap Colors using Sass variables  How to Customize Bootstrap Colors using Sass maps    How to Customize Bootstrap Navbar  How to Customize Bootstrap Carousel   How to Edit Bootstrap CSS  You can edit Bootstrap’s core files directly to make changes to your site — but it’s not recommended.
 Making changes directly to the default Bootstrap stylesheet will quickly become difficult to maintain.
Not only is it harder to keep track of the changes you made, but it also makes upgrading to a newer version of Bootstrap a lot more painful.
When upgrading, you’ll have to replace the core files, so all of your customizations will be lost.
 The good news is there’s a way to make changes without editing the Bootstrap source code.
Let’s take a closer look at this process below.
 Can you override Bootstrap CSS?
 If you want to customize your Bootstrap site, leave the source code as-is and simply add custom code in an external stylesheet.
The code in this external stylesheet will override the existing styles, as long as it’s set up properly.
This set-up process differs slightly depending on how you load Bootstrap on your site.
 There are a few different ways to get started with Bootstrap .
You can use BootstrapCDN to deliver a cached version of Bootstrap’s compiled CSS and JS to your project, or you can download the precompiled or source code version of Bootstrap.
 Below, we’ll walk through the process for customizing each of these Bootstrap versions.
   How to Override Bootstrap CSS  You can override the default styles of Bootstrap elements using two possible methods.
The first way — using CSS overrides— applies to sites using BootstrapCDN or the pre-compiled versions of Bootstrap.
The second — using Sass variables — applies to sites using the source code version of Bootstrap.
 Each method is ideal for different use cases.
While using CSS overrides is simpler, it is also more time-consuming and difficult to scale.
Using Sass variables, on the other hand, is ideal for making more extensive changes across your site — but it’s designed for more advanced users.
Let’s take a closer look at both approaches below   How to Override Bootstrap Using CSS Overrides  Whether you’re using BootstrapCDN or the pre-compiled version, you’ll start with a basic HTML5 doctype that looks something like this:   <!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  	<meta charset="utf-8">
  	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
  	<title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  	<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>  This will be your index.html file.
The next step is loading Bootstrap onto your site.
 If you’re going with BootstrapCDN, there’s no need to download any files.
Simply add the following line of code into the <head> section of your index.html file:   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-B0vP5xmATw1+K9KRQjQERJvTumQW0nPEzvF6L/Z6nronJ3oUOFUFpCjEUQouq2+l" crossorigin="anonymous">  This will load Bootstrap CSS on your site.
Note that if you want to load Bootstrap Javascript, then you’ll have to add some code into the <body> section.
Since that’s not necessary for this override method, we’ll skip this step.
 If you’re going with the compiled version of Bootstrap, then you’ll have to download the compiled CSS files and save them in the same folder as your index.html file.
Then add the following line of code into the <head> section of your index.html file:   <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css">  Once you’ve completed this step, you’ll have successfully linked to Bootstrap’s default stylesheet.
Now it’s time to create your own stylesheet.
 To do so, simply create another file in the same folder as your index.html file.
You can call this file “custom.css" as this is where you’ll put your custom CSS.
 But before you start adding to this file, go back to your index.html file and add the following line of code directly under the link to the default stylesheet.
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom.css">  The reference to the custom.css must come after the bootstrap.css for this CSS override customization method to work.
Why?
Because of the rule of CSS specificity .
If HTML elements are targeted by multiple CSS selectors of the same specificity, the last one will override the others and only its style properties will apply.
By linking to your custom stylesheet after the default stylesheet, you give it a higher level of specificity.
 With this addition, here is what your index.html file will look like if you’re using BootstrapCDN.
  <!doctype HTML>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  	<meta charset="utf-8">
  	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

 Access now     Learn more           How to Customize Bootstrap Buttons Using CSS Overrides  Let’s say you want to make the font size of button text bigger on your site.
In Bootstrap, the default font size for the .btn class is 16px, as shown below.
 You can change it to, say, 20px by using the CSS font-size property in your stylesheet.
Using a class selector, you can change the font size of all elements under the .btn class to 20px using the following code.
  .btn { 
  font-size: 20px 
}  Here’s the result:  Following the same process, you can make as many changes as needed to transform your Bootstrap site.
Just make sure to use CSS selectors that are as specific as — or more specific than — those in the bootstrap.css file.
 Once you’re done making changes, save the custom.css file.
At any time, you can edit or remove any of your custom CSS to revert to Bootstrap’s default styles or redesign your site.
You can also easily switch to another version of Bootstrap (as long as it’s a minor release, like 4.4) by replacing the reference to the previous stylesheet in your index.html file.
 Now that we understand this customization option and its benefits, let’s look at the other customization option that applies to site owners using the source code version of Bootstrap.
  How to Override Bootstrap Using Sass  Downloading the source code version of Bootstrap is the most difficult method for loading Bootstrap on your site because it requires additional tools to set up the source files, like Bootstrap’s official compiled versions.
That’s because the latest major release of Bootstrap — Bootstrap 5 — is written in Sass , a CSS extension language that must be compiled for browsers to understand and render it correctly.
 You’ll need a Sass compiler and autoprefixer to do this.
but, once you invest the time in setting up this version of Bootstrap, you’ll have complete control over your code and Bootstrap’s code.
That’s why this method appeals to more advanced users.
 Let’s say you choose to download the Bootstrap source code using a package manager like npm, then you’ll unzip the folder and see the following structure.
 your-project/  └── scss  │        └── custom.scss  └── node_modules/  └── bootstrap  └── js  └── scss  Notice that the folder labeled “custom.scss” — which will act as your own stylesheet — is separate from the bootstrap/scss folder — which is the default stylesheet.
It’s important to note that if you’re not using a package manager, you’ll just want to manually set up a similar file structure that keeps Bootstrap’s source files separate from your own.
 As with the other customization method, you still avoid modifying Bootstrap’s core files.
What’s different for Sass is that in your own stylesheet, you’ll import Bootstrap Sass files so you can modify them.
 Go to your custom.scss file.
You can import all Bootstrap’s source Sass by including the following line of code.
  @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";  Or, you can just pick and choose the files you need.
The following code imports the files required for customization.
  @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";  The code below is for importing optional files.
You can always add this or other code in later as you begin customizing.
  @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/reboot";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/type";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/images";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/code";
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/grid";  Once this is set up, you can begin to make changes.
There’s no need to add a reference to the stylesheet in your index.html file, so you’ll stay in your custom.scss file.
 Instead of adding custom CSS like in the other method, you’ll modify any of the 500 Sass variables and maps in Bootstrap .
The complete list can be found in your scss/_variables.scss file, but let’s focus on two specific examples used in Bootstrap’s documentation.
Each example demonstrates how to customize Bootstrap colors using either Sass variables or maps.

 Access now     Learn more           How to Customize Bootstrap Colors Using Sass Variables  By default, the Sass variables for the <body> element in Bootstrap are:   $body-bg: $white !default;
$body-color: $gray-900 !default;  This means that the background color is white and the color is gray.
Let’s say you want to change these colors.
 See how both variables have a !default flag?
That allows you to override the variable’s default value in your own Sass without modifying Bootstrap’s source code.
You simply have to copy and paste the variables in your custom.scss file, change their values, and delete the !default flag.
 So if I want to change the background-color and color of the <body> element to black and dark gray, respectively, I’d add the following to my custom.scss file.
  $body-bg: #000;
$body-color: #111;  To successfully make this override across Sass files, I have to finalize the import of Bootstrap’s Sass files by adding the following code after the variables:   @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";  This is similar to how you have to include both references to your stylesheets in the <head> of your index.html file in the previous method.
 Putting this all together, here’s what your custom.scss file would look like if you imported all the Bootstrap files:   @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
$body-bg: #000;
$body-color: #111;
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";   How to Customize Bootstrap Colors Using Sass Maps  Bootstrap also includes Sass maps, which are basically related groups of Sass variables.
For example, there are Sass maps for colors and grid breakpoints in Bootstrap.
Like Sass variables, Sass maps include the !default flag so they can be overridden without modifying Bootstrap’s source code.
 For example, the Sass map for colors in Bootstrap is:   $theme-colors: () !default;
// stylelint-disable-next-line scss/dollar-variable-default
$theme-colors: map-merge(
	(
  		"primary": $primary,
  		"secondary": $secondary,
  		"success": $success,
  		"info": $info,
  		"warning": $warning,
  		"danger": $danger,
  		"light": $light,
  		"dark": $dark
	),
	$theme-colors
);  With Sass maps, you have two options — you can modify the map, or you can add to it.
 Let’s say you want to change an existing color in the $theme-colors map.
You simply have to copy and paste the map key and include only the variables you want to change in your custom.scss file.
Then, change their values and delete the !default flag.
 So if you wanted to change the primary color to cyan-blue, you’d add the following to your custom Sass file:   $theme-colors: (
	"primary": #0074d9,
);  This would change the primary theme color across the CSS, so .alert-primary, .text-primary, .bg-primary, and more would all be affected.
 And if you wanted to add a new color to the $theme-colors map, then you’d add a new key, use the variable “custom-color”, and assign it a value.
The following would add a crimson red to the map.
  $theme-colors: (
	"custom-color": #990000,
);  Now that we understand the two different customization options that Bootstrap users have, let's look at how to customize a Bootstrap navbar and carousel using either CSS or Sass.
That way, you can customize these elements no matter what version of Bootstrap you're using.
  How to Customize Bootstrap Navbar  Let’s say I create a standard Bootstrap navbar with links to a homepage, features page, and pricing page that collapses its content behind a hamburger button at the small breakpoint (576px).
Here’s how it looks when expanded.
  Now let’s look at how to customize it using CSS overrides or Sass variables.
 Using CSS  Let’s say I want to change the navbar-brand, which typically designates a company, product, or project name.
By default, the navbar-brand has a font color of black and a font size of 20px.
 You can change it to a shade of purple and 24px by using the CSS color and font-size properties in your stylesheet respectively.
You’ll use two class selectors: the class name of the nav element and anchor element that is the navbar-brand.
Below is the code.
  .navbar .navbar-brand {
	color: #94128A;
  	font-size: 24px;
}  Here’s the result:   Note: In the HTML, I replaced “Navbar” in between the <a></a> tags with “MyCompany” name as well.
 The challenge of using CSS overrides is that you have to understand CSS specificity and know what selectors are used in the default Bootstrap stylesheet (bootstrap.css) so you can use more specific ones.
 And, even if you can do that, you’re still limited in your customization options.
Using CSS overrides makes one-off changes to individual elements or groups of elements.
And it doesn’t change the appearance of elements in pseudo-states like ":hover", ":active", and “disabled”.
 If you’d like to make more extensive changes to your stylesheet, then you’d need to use Sass.
 Using Sass  Let’s say I want to change the font color of the navbar items and use a different color for when they are active and when a user hovers over them.
Here are the default Sass variables for a navbar-light element in Bootstrap:   $navbar-light-color: rgba($black, .5) !default;
$navbar-light-hover-color: rgba($black, .7) !default;
$navbar-light-active-color: rgba($black, .9) !default;  That means by default, the font color of the items in a light navbar is black.
Let’s change these colors.
 Remember that the !default flag means you can override the variable’s default value in your own Sass without modifying Bootstrap’s source code.
Just copy and paste the variables in your custom.scss file, change their values, and delete the !default flag.

 Access now     Learn more           So if I want to change the color of the navbar items to the equivalent of the Sass variable $gray-900, I’d use the hex code #212529.
And if I wanted to change the color of the navbar items when active or when a user hovering over them to the Sass variable $indigo, then I’d use the hex code #6610f2.
Here’s the total code I’d add to my custom.scss file.
  @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
$navbar-light-color: #212529;
$navbar-light-hover-color: #6610f2;
$navbar-light-active-color: #6610f2;
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";  Here’s the result:    How to Customize Bootstrap Carousel  Let’s say I create a standard Bootstrap carousel with images of puppies.
Here’s how it looks.
  Now let’s look at how to customize it using CSS overrides or Sass variables or maps.
 Using CSS  Let’s say I want to change the height of the images in the carousel slider.
I can do so using the type selector img.
Below is the code.
  img { 
  height: 500px;
}  Here’s the result:   Using Sass  Let’s say I want to change the style of the three indicators at the bottom.
Here are the default Sass variables for the width and height of the carousel indicators:   $carousel-indicator-width: 30px !default;
$carousel-indicator-height: 3px !default;  That means by default, the width of the indicators is 30px and the height is 3px.
 Let’s say I want to increase both the width and height to make these indicators stand out more.
I’d copy and paste the variables in my custom.scss file, change their values, and delete the !default flag.
Here’s the code:   @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
$carousel-indicator-width: 100px;
$carousel-indicator-height: 10px;
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";  Here’s the result:   Creating and Customizing a Bootstrap Site  Whether you’re using CSS overrides or Sass variables, you can unlock hundreds of customization options in Bootstrap.
This way, you can not only build a responsive site — you can also design it to suit your brand.
You’ll just need to be comfortable with HTML and CSS to do so.

The page opens strongly above the fold.
Editorial photos of artists greeted me.
I noted recent favorites, like Doja Cat, and the label’s historic musicians, like Elvis and David Bowie.
 The words art, records, and culture appear on screen.
When I hovered over them with my circular cursor, the text distorted.
I also had the option to click “make noise” so I could hear music throughout my experience.
  Image Source  The rest of the page makes use of animations.
When I hovered over images, I could see information about recent singles.
Marquee-style scrollers showed artist names and songs.
 When I hovered over these bars, videos of the musicians performing appeared.
  Image Source  What I like: Movement across the site keeps the experience engaging and makes me want to explore further.

 Image Source  The introduction section features dark text over a light background.
Here, you can learn about design broadly and explore the report’s methodology.
 Below that, there are subsections introduced with light text over a dark background.

 When the page loaded, I was presented with a beautifully designed room that shifted slightly as I moved my mouse.
The soundtrack to the site featured ethereal tones paired with playful percussion.
 I clicked on dots to learn more about the different items on display.
 Image Source  Some points of exploration were for products, like the PLIÉ PLISSÉ light that shifts as the ambient light of your room changes.
Others were for general points of interest, like the cranes featured in the space.

Hyer  Award: Website of the Month (2022), CSS Design Awards  Want to make a strong impression on your website visitors?
Take a page out of Hyer’s book .
  Image Source  This striking illustration of the airplane, as it slowly moves across the screen, is sure to grab website visitors’ attention.
 This page has everything you need in an effective homepage: An image that tells a story but isn’t too distracting, the use of white space, an easy nav bar, a tagline or slogan, and a clear call-to-action (CTA).
 It’s a clean design that’s free of any distractions and invites visitors to learn more about the brand.
 What I like: Smooth scrolling transitions, simple layout, and excellent copy — especially this part: “…in a world where passengers have become numbers, a personal approach is key.”    We're committed to your privacy.

Mubasic  Award: Website of the Day, August 10, 2022, Awwwards  Mubasic’s site isn’t just visually compelling.
It’s dynamic.
Mubasic is a catalog of high-quality music for children, and the website’s design decisions help it achieve a light-hearted, easy-going feel.
 The poppy color scheme and effective visual hierarchy contribute to this site’s design success.
However, the real reason it shines is because of how the design feels authentic to the brand’s mission.
 Image Source  The homepage easily allows you to explore the company’s offerings and even features a Q&A section set up in a unique format.
Images pop up as you scroll down the page.
 Toward the bottom, there’s the opportunity to get in touch with contact information and a new customer form template.
 When you reach the bottom of the homepage, there’s a menu that features anchors to allow you to jump to wherever the information you’re seeking lives on the page.
 What I like: The color palette and the brand’s “less is more” approach make the site so simple and fun at the same time.
 9.
Digital Cover  Award: Website of the Day, July 31, 2022, Awwwards  Everything from the loading screen to the homepage of this France-based digital agency’s website is a visual homerun.
When you arrive on this homepage, you’re immediately swept into the world of Digital Cover.
 This is achieved by a graphic that appears nearly three-dimensional, popping up and welcoming you into the company’s orbit.
  Image Source  Similar to the previous site, the animated nature of Digital Cover’s homepage adds intrigue and establishes this site as a candidate for best website design.
 With a simple swipe of a mouse pad, you’re led to the company’s projects, or you can navigate to the clearly labeled menu in the top left corner.
When you do, several options pop up.
 From there, you are escorted to the page of your selection.
The white lettering against the black background allows for the copy to pop.
 If you scroll to the bottom of any menu page, you’ll find contact information to get in touch with the agency, which is another strength of the design.
 What I like: The dark and mysterious vibe with the surprise element.
It’s super cool how products seem to come towards me with 3D motion.
 Best Website Designs from 2021  10.
Superlist  Award: Site of the Month (April 2021), Awwwards  Superlist is a productivity app that helps teams and individuals change the way they work.
 Too often, you land on a website and have to figure out what the brand is about.
With Superlist, you know exactly what to expect as soon as you get to the homepage.
  Image Source  The interactive homepage has an on-point copy, showing what the site is all about.
There are three easy-to-notice buttons that clearly show how the app supports teamwork, personal tasks, and everything in between.
 Superlist effectively uses white space to keep the focus on its copy.
When you scroll down, you can see interesting motion transitions.
The fun visuals continue until the end of the site, keeping us engaged all the time.
 What I like: Playful transitions and a big CTA button which changes colors when you hover over it with the mouse.
 Best Website Designs from 2020  11.
Swab the World  Award: Site of the Day (2020), Awwwards  Parallax , bold colors, and negative space shape the design and experience of Swab the World’s website.
The organization brings awareness to stem cell donations.
 Their mission is to “Make sure every single patient finds their match.
Period.” Photos of couples exhibiting love and emotions bring a human element to a historically complex and scientific process.
 From a technical perspective, the design makes moving down the page feel natural, ensuring the readers reach each point of copy and every CTA on the homepage.
  Image Source  What I like: How the color changes show that everyone, no matter their race, deserves to be healthy and needs to have the same rights.

Newest Americans  Award: Honorable Mention (2020), Awwwards  An organization with a responsibility as large as honoring past, present, and future migrating identities needs a beautiful and functional website to help spread the word.
 Newest Americans champion immigrant experiences in cities across the state of New Jersey.
 The website uses beautiful imagery of people, places, and items that represent this experience in a way that flows cohesively down the homepage, telling the story of this group of America’s newest citizens.
 The website is both visually appealing and functional, with a simple navigation menu, stories organized by photos, and a clean press page that puts the most recent articles front and center.
  Image Source  What I like: The slow-motion video in the background and full-screen images with titles leading to articles.
 13.
Spotify Design  Award: Honorable Mention (2020), Awwwards  Spotify is known for its fair share of amazing feats, and its latest iteration of Spotify Design is no different.
 Serving as the hub for all things visual and creative for Spotify, the music and podcast streaming giant gives listeners a look into the who, what, why, and how of what makes the app so sensational.
 Bright colors, drop shadows, and smooth animations give this website character and depth.
The flat geometric designs with abstract accents make albums and artists practically jump off of the screen.
  Image Source  Looking for more design inspiration from microsites like this one?

 What I like: Animations, illustrations, color scheme, and automatic sliding feature that switches between articles.
 14.
Andy Warhol  Award: Honorable Mention (2020), Awwwards  Artist, film director, and producer Andy Warhol’s life is encapsulated in this splendidly designed website that captures his art style in a digital format.
 As you peruse the page, your cursor becomes a spotlight that converts every image you hover over into a negative image or inverses the colors of the text you’re reading.
 The big, bold text makes a statement and emphasizes just how important copy is to website design.
Subtle animations help pace the site and set the tone for each section as you peruse the homepage.
  Image Source  What I like: Horizontal scrolling, artistic colors, and storytelling vibe.
 15.
Human Interaction Company  Award: Corporate Website (2020), Red Dot  To see the video done right, look no further than the Human Interaction Company .
From the moment you click on the site, the experience is lightning-fast.
 You’re dropped directly into the action — the why, what, and how of Human Interaction and exactly what the team does.
 This Red Dot Design Award winner aims to bring the study of human interaction to the masses and, in the process, show us just how engaging it can be to learn about it.
 Don’t get discouraged by their award status, though — none of the photos on this site are photoshopped, so it’s a practical example of building quality with the resources you have available.
  Image Source  What I like: The changing background videos with colorful scenes, zooming images, and smooth transitions.
 16.
Garoa Skincare  Award: Site of the Day (2020), Awwwards  How do you transform the feeling of luxury and practicality into a website?
Garoa Skincare provides a blueprint.
 Whether your product costs half the price of your closest competitor or twice the price, your site can bring a sense of extravagance to just about any product you sell.
 High-quality visuals, typefaces that complement each other, and a balance of negative space with useful copy can bring a simple elegance to your website.
  Image Source  What I like: The earthy colors, fresh and clean appearance, and the font choice.
I love the layout as well!  Best Website Designs from 2019  17.
1917: In the Trenches  Award: Awwwards’ Best Website of the Day (2019)  This website , made to promote the film 1917, lets you walk around the trenches and perform the same mission that the characters did in the film.
You can also see their maps or access other tools.
 This is a great example of a site that went above and beyond with interactivity as well as a site that leverages its content and prewritten storyline to market its film.
 This website won Site of the Day by Awwwards , which allows designers to vote and nominate great websites they see daily.
 Image Source  What I like: The homepage, especially frame 17 with the burning sky and ash scene, is so captivating.
The 3D movement around the site is fantastic, too.
Honestly, I’ve never seen a better film promotion.
 18.
The Octopus: A design blog by IDEO  Award: Business Blog/Website 2019 Webby award  IDEO, a global design company, won the Business Blog/Website 2019 Webby award for its Octopus blog , and for good reason.
 Overall, the whole IDEO site is fantastic.
 A few seconds after you enter the homepage, catchy yellow and pink letters will overlay the black-and-white text and add a pop of color.
  Image Source  If you hover over a blog post, the title is highlighted in yellow.
If you hover over an image, the image is pulled towards you — two small features that make a big difference in terms of creating a unique and engaging user experience.
 What I like: The text animation at the top of the website and the feature that highlights the blog posts’ titles.
 19.
Nomadic Tribe  Award: Awwwards’ Site of the Year nomination (2019)  This site, which was nominated for Awwwards’ Site of the Year, is one of the most engaging sites I’ve seen.
 The homepage immediately begins playing a stunning video featuring a man walking across a desert, followed by gorgeous landscape scenes and text like, “Are you lucky enough to call yourself an adventurer?”  The text throughout the website is playful, with colorful pinks and oranges and yellows, and the homepage is logically designed, with CTAs placed throughout that range in commitment level from “Read More” to “Watch Now” and, finally, “Download the App.”  Ultimately, the website is beautifully designed with strong attention to detail and tells a compelling story throughout.
  Image Source  What I like: The scenes of desserts and safaris on the homepage, the storytelling vibe, and the “Featured Nomadi” section.
I also love the symbolic icons in the navigation bar.
 20.
Diana Danieli  Award: Webby 2019  This 2019 Webby-winning site shows off imagery of art and architecture with either high contrast or heavy exposure.
As a website visitor, you can click and drag your mouse to change the photos and variations.
 Each image shows a piece of work that highlights the artist who owns the website.
 A cool plus about this website is its incorporation of audio and music.
Click certain buttons on the screen to play piano notes and be truly immersed in the Diana Danieli experience.

   Image Source  What I like: The dark background with production videos and the focus on using wood for furniture.
I love the simplicity, minimalism, and black-and-white theme.
 21.
George Nakashima Woodworkers  Award: Webby 2019  This woodworking website emphasizes nature and care for the woodworking trade.
It’s essentially a slideshow of beautiful forestry and farming images.
 As a new image comes on the screen, a new quote related to wood or trees also appears.
 This is incredibly relaxing to the visitor and shows that the woodworkers recognize the beauty of trees and the environment.
This website also won a Webby in 2019 .
  Image Source  What I like: The earthy color palette, clear layout, quotes about wood, and beautiful nature pictures.
 Best Website Designs from 2018  22.
Crypton.trading  Award: Site of the Day (4/3/2018), Awwwards  Meet crypton.trading, your robot accountant.
 Crypton.trading is a trading hub for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, using artificial intelligence to predict changes in a currency’s value and identify key buying and selling opportunities.
 The website was rated high for its development and design, as it gradually explains more of the developer’s methods the further down visitors scroll.
 This website makes tech-savvy visitors feel right at home the moment Crypton’s greeting appears across the homepage, one letter at a time.
 Image Source  What I like: The interactive graph that changes as you scroll, displaying features like “sell” and “gain.”  23.
Overflow  Award: Site of the Day (3/20/2018), Best Website Gallery  Overflow is a design tool that allows people and businesses to create story-like flow diagrams of their ideas so they’re easier for others to understand.
 Aside from this being just a good service, the Overflow website practices what it preaches — the website promotes its product using a flow diagram.
 The website delivers this flow diagram in the form of a video.
 While embedded videos can look clunky sitting in the middle of a website’s other design elements, Overflow’s is perfectly placed and exactly what you’d want to see when landing on the site for the first time.
 Check out our SaaS web design post for more inspiration.
   Image Source  What I like: The design feels fresh and modern.
But what really grabs my attention are the motioned flow diagram and those short product “presentations.”  24.
Frans Hals Museum  Award: Site of the Year (2018), Awwwards  It can be tough for a museum to present all of its artwork together on a cohesive website.
That’s what makes the website of the Frans Hals Museum so impressive.
 Located in the Netherlands, this museum has created a website that uses a combination of digital design elements and its own exhibits.
 This mixture helps visitors understand what they’ll see, when they can see it, and where else they can get a taste of what this museum has to offer.
  Image Source  What I like: The blend of history and modern elements.
I also like the huge letters, bright colors, and interactive transitions.

Simply Chocolate  Award: Site of the Year (2017), Awwwards  You’ll get a craving for chocolate just looking at this website — and in a way, that’s Simply Chocolate’s website working as designed.
 This appetizing website is that of Denmark chocolate maker Simply Chocolate.
Its website uses a variety of colors (and creative product names) to promote each chocolate bar.
 And as you scroll from one product to the next, they all seem to remain consistent in brand.
 The vibrant yellow package and yummy chocolates in the bowl make you feel like you can grab it off of your computer screen, while the “Order Now” CTA to the top-left is ideally placed for users to select the products they want while browsing.
  Image Source  What I like: Sleek design, simple layout and mouth-watering images.
One of my favorite parts is the video showing how they make chocolate.
 26.
NOWNESS  Award: Best Cultural Blog/Website, 2017 Webby Awards  NOWNESS is perhaps the coolest crowdsourced video blog on the internet.
That was a mouthful.
What does it all mean?
 NOWNESS’ crowdsourcing is part of what makes it an award-winner.
This means most of its content comes from independent creatives — an increasingly popular way for businesses to publish content.
 NOWNESS is also a video channel, meaning all of its blog content is in video format.
Together, these qualities help make NOWNESS a captivating hub for the stories that brands everywhere strive to tell.
 Image Source  What I like: I fell in love with the presentation video in the center of the homepage.
I also like the journal-style design and the simple black-and-white theme.
 Other Cool Website Designs  27.
Guillaume Tomasi  As a Photographer in Montreal, Guillaume Tomasi has built a portfolio that’s truly fit to house his unique and awe-inspiring photography.
 His surreal photo style is juxtaposed by his simple, flat, empty, and minimalistic portfolio design that places all of the focus on the work itself.
 His unique series navigation, coupled with art-gallery-inspired introductions and perfect scrolling interactions, yield an experience reminiscent of that of a real gallery   Image Source  What I like: The mosaic layout with moving images.
It feels like a big bubble is spinning, showing the picture inside.
 28.
Tej Chauhan  Tej Chauhan has turned impressionist artwork into a business model with this intriguing website.
 Each image on this product developer’s homepage slides out to cover the previous image, offering little context around the object you now see in front of you.
But it’s that lack of context that makes you want to learn more.
 Plus, the tagline, “Souvenirs of The Near Future,” suggests these objects are a part of their product line — and an opportunity for you to bring these innovative objects into your life.
   Image Source  Want a similar look for your website?
Check out the new Content Hub theme collection on the Envato marketplace.
 What I like: The swift transition between images of products/designs.
I love the simplicity, which focuses on displaying the offer rather than excessive talking.
 29.
Amanda Martocchio Architecture  An architecture firm might not specialize in web development, but its website should still demonstrate its commitment to visually pleasing design.
Amanda Martocchio took that to heart with this gorgeous website.
 It’s no secret that Amanda Martocchio Architecture loves its work — each picture on the homepage of its website is an enchanting shot of the houses the company designs.
 The website labels every house you scroll through with the type of design that was intended, along with numerous angles to each building.
  Image Source  What I like: The luxurious feel and photo-centric design.
 Modern Website Design Examples  30.
Donaldson Clinic  I love the fresh, minimalist design of Donaldson Clinic’s website.
It’s sleek and modern and reflects the clinic’s professionalism and innovation.
  Image Source  Having an introduction to the doctors right on the homepage is a smart move — it quickly builds trust, which is especially important for sites of this nature.
  Image Source  The high-quality imagery highlights the clinic’s facilities and makes it all look high-end.
 With trust indicators and clear CTAs, it’s incredibly easy to feel confident and take the next step.
 What I like: The “Procedures and treatments” section is definitely the biggest highlight.
I love the aesthetic images that show Donaldson follows current trends.
   Image Source  31.
Pony Studio  Pony Studio’s website is one of the coolest sites I’ve seen.
  Image Source  The mix of dark colors with bright pops is eye-catching, and I love the dynamic nature with motion, illustrations, and 3D elements.
 As you scroll, you’ll see the super interesting case studies and integration of user feedback.
   Image Source  Every part of this site makes you want to explore more.
 What I like: Probably the best part of the Pony site is how they showcase their team.
 Boxes switch between current images and childhood photos of each member — it’s adorable, unique, and unlike anything I’ve seen before.
Plus, instead of full names, they only use names or nicknames below each picture.
   Image Source  32.
Lacoste Heritage  To celebrate Lacoste’s 90th anniversary, the brand collaborated with Bonhomme to showcase its story.
 In April 2023, Awwwards recognized Lacoste Heritage , awarding it Site of the Day (SOTD) and DEVAWARD recognitions .
The site excels in usability and overall design.
 It displays Lacoste’s popular products through fantastic background video and image choices.
   Image Source  As you scroll, you’ll notice a charming feature: a small Lacoste crocodile that turns over and follows the mouse cursor — so original!   Image Source  What I like: The site has great categorization, relevant links, and concise text, guiding you through the brand’s narrative and products.
 33.
Unseen Studio  Unseen Studio is a creative studio crafting unique ideas and visuals to help brands stand out.
In my opinion, it has one of the most beautiful sites ever.
 Awwwards proves my point by naming it the Site of the Month (SOTM) for February 2023.
 First, a page opens with semi-open eyes representing “Unseen.”  Then, you can choose to enter the site by pressing the button.
It’s also possible to turn off the music in advance if it bothers you.
  Image Source  When you enter the main homepage, it has a faded pink color prevailing.
Everything is 3D and looks like a dreamland.
 Moving the cursor across the page makes everything move and come alive.
 The best part is when you hover over water — it creates ripples.
  Image Source  I don’t typically enjoy a ton of motion and background sound, but this site is so calming.
 What I like: There are just three categories on the site — one leading to projects, the second to the index, and the third to the contact form.
 34.
ETQ  ETQ takes a minimalist approach to ecommerce.
Big, compelling visuals of their product lay against simple, flat backgrounds accompanied by strong typography that keeps the focus on exactly what the user came there to see: shoes.

 35.
Cyclemon  Cyclemon’s website is like a colorful picture book that you’ll love flipping through!  There’s a vertical side menu on the right to guide you where you want to go.
  Image Source  As you scroll, the pictures move smoothly, making it feel like you’re taking a fun ride.
 These pictures are actually awesome posters they offer.
There are so many cool things that I just had to keep scrolling to see them all.
 For instance, check out this one:    Image Source  What I like: Overall, I have just two words for this website: less is more.
 Everything’s perfectly illustrated, with just three categories to choose from.
You can go to “Experiment,” aka the homepage, “Show more” to learn about the founders, or “Shop” to pick your poster.
It’s that simple.
 36.
Silencio  I’ve never had such a fun experience on any site like I had on Silencio .
 On the homepage, you first see packaged products moving in the background.
  Image Source  As you scroll, you follow products through various stages.
They get scanned at each step with a store scanner sound and light.
Even a receipt pops up in the right corner.
  Image Source  You keep scrolling until the last step at the bottom, when the products finally land in the cart.
 I have to admit — I scrolled through the page several times just to enjoy the interactive process.
 What I like: The interactive experience with the minimalist design creates a great visual and engaging website.
 37.
Alexander McQuin  What I like about the Alexander McQueen website is how it tells the story of the brand.
  Image Source  It shows where McQueen came from, his background in tailoring, and how he revolutionized fashion.
 The coolest detail is definitely a tailor’s measuring tape.
  Image Source  What I like: The website is easy to navigate, and the design is minimalist and luxurious.
It feels like a high-end fashion magazine, with a strong focus on images and minimal text.
 38.
Gapsy  Since I'm a big fan of 3D sites, I simply had to include Gapsy on the list.
 The homepage features text that resembles street graffiti on a wall.
  Image Source  As you scroll, the page moves horizontally.
You’ll get the impression of entering a gallery where you can view projects and case studies and learn more about the company and service.
  Image Source  What I like: The concept is brilliant and intuitive and makes exploring the website enjoyable.
That’s what I love most — when a website sells an experience, not just an intrusive offer.
 39.
Leif  Let’s end our list with Leif , an ecommerce site that makes you want to spruce up your home the moment you land on it.
 Everything feels fresh and clean here, dominated by white and beige tones.
 I especially love the picture choice — they’re not typical boring images with a white background.
Leif uses real-life snapshots and products in actual home settings.
  Image Source  You’ll also see handwritten CTAs and headings, giving the brand a cozy, personal touch.
  Image Source  What I like: Unlike most online stores, the navigation is on the side instead of at the top, so it makes it easier to find what you’re looking for.
  Where to Get Your Design Inspiration  If you want some design inspo, the good news is that you can find it just about everywhere.
 One of the best ways to get inspiration for design is through travel.
When you visit new places, you’re forced to get out of your comfort zone and experience something foreign.
 What makes design so interesting is that everyone sees it differently and so, there’s always more to discover.
 Another way to get design inspiration IRL is through the media.
Every day, we are inundated with visual content.
We make decisions about what we like, what we don’t like, and continue on our day.
 But what if you were more intentional about how you viewed those interactions?
You could come out of it with valuable insights.
 You also can’t forget to leverage design communities.
From design conferences to Reddit forums, there are hundreds of groups out there that can offer inspiration as well as advice.
 Now that we’ve covered some IRL design inspiration sources, let’s cover the digital ones.

   Website Design Ideas  Now that you’ve seen a number of beautifully designed and award-winning platforms, keep these potential ideas in mind as you create your own.
 Here are a few suggestions I have to help you create a site that could appear on our best website design inspiration list.
  Consider ways that you can make your website interactive, like the 1917 example.
 Make a website that emphasizes the mobile experience , even while it still has a good UX on desktops.
 Create a website that tells a story about your brand with photos, text, or video.
 If you can’t create a heavily interactive site, consider drawing in eyes with a site that presents a slideshow of your photos.
 Ensure your CTAs are easy to see and encourage visitors to continue exploring your site.
 Keep navigation clean .
Ensure your visitors always know how to get back to the homepage.
 Integrate your social media sites via social embed buttons, so site visitors can easily follow you on your various social channels.
 Keep each of your web pages consistent in design — including font, colors, images, and messaging.
 Test your website’s usability with a heat map , which will show you which web pages your visitors are most likely to bounce.
 Include a live chat or chatbot to give visitors the option to engage with you directly on your website if they prefer live chat to phone calls.
Live chat can automate functions for your sales and service reps and create a better communication experience for the customer.
 Get an SSL certificate to ensure your website is secure.
SSL is part of Google’s search ranking algorithm , so an SSL certificate can help you rank higher in search.
   Modern Website Design Tips  Modern times call for modern websites.
 I’ve recently listened to a great episode of The Futur podcast with Vitaly Friedman , who shared his blueprint for modern website design.
 Here are some of his best tips:   Skip the guesswork.
Conduct testing to validate your design decisions.
Create tasks that mirror real-life situations and recruit a diverse group of at least 15 participants to give feedback.
 Keep your design clear for everyone.
Be mindful that what seems obvious to one person might not be so clear to another.
Make it all look clear, fresh, and easy to understand.
 Make sure everyone has a good experience.
Pay attention to accessibility features for screen reader users and people with disabilities.
Focus on color contrast, typography, font sizes, and tab target sizes.
 Feel the vibes.
Understand users’ emotional responses and brand perception through qualitative methods like descriptive feedback.
 Embrace the quirks.
Imperfections and human mistakes make the design interesting.
Or, as Vitaly Friedman says, “Sometimes I can smell your GPT text.
I want to see TYPOS.”  Change is good.
Be open to trying new things, making improvements, and bringing innovations.
 Stir up some emotions.
Aim to surprise, delight, or even challenge your users to create memorable experiences.
 Add a sprinkle of humor.
Injecting some fun into unexpected places like terms and conditions can make users feel right at home.
  Watch the whole episode here:  [Video: Blueprint For Modern Web Design: Deep Dive w/ Vitaly Friedman ]  Let me now show you a case study of the updated website, which implemented some of these tips.

  Image Source  Some images have a neat little motion that makes me feel the aroma of freshly brewed coffee through the screen.
 I also love the easy navigation with good button placement.
  Image Source  Moreover, I didn’t know that the app was available, but I quickly found it thanks to its great position on the site.
There’s also a download option and a clear CTA.
  Image Source  The “+” icons in the bar are super handy, too.
They show which categories have more content below and which will take you to another site directly.

 Download Now          Updated: 03/29/24   Published: 03/29/24           What is website development?
  Website development broadly refers to the tasks and processes involved in creating and maintaining a website.
This includes everything from markup and coding to scripting, network configuration, and CMS development.
     As someone who's spent countless hours coding and experimenting with websites, I've come to see web development as more than just markup and coding; it's an art form, a way of bringing ideas to life.
While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website development includes all related development tasks, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security configuration, ecommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.
 For those looking for a more streamlined and user-friendly approach, HubSpot's drag-and-drop website builder offers a practical solution, allowing you to focus on design and content without the need for extensive coding knowledge.
  If you're interested in the ins-and-outs of web development, I’m excited to share with you the basics of web development and the exhilarating process of creating a website from scratch.
I remember the first website I ever built—it was full of bright colors and clunky animations, but it was mine, and it sparked a lifelong passion.
Through trial and error, I've personally discovered the joy of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

That's more than half of our global population, actively engaging in research, connection, education, and entertainment through this incredible digital universe.
Personally, I believe the Internet isn’t just a luxury; it's a fundamental part of our daily lives.
 Given the rapidly increasing number of Internet users, it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly expanding industry.
Between now and 2030, the employment of web developers is expected to grow by 13% , much faster than most other technology careers.
It's an exciting time to be in this field, and I'm thrilled to be part of this dynamic industry.

Web Programming  Web development and web programming sound very similar — and they are.
But there’s one very important distinction.
 Web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications, including the project’s design, layout, coding, content creation, and functionality.
It involves using a combination of programming languages, tools, and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life.
It may also encompass project management activities, such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or freelance clients.
 Web programming, on the other hand, specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website, whether the front-end or back-end.
It primarily involves writing code to handle data, process user inputs, and generate dynamic content.
A web programmer will rarely, if ever, handle a web development project from end to end.
They may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs.
             Understanding this difference has been crucial in my career, allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth of skills required in the world of web creation.
It's a reminder of the diverse talents and expertise that come together to make the digital world what it is today.
                Web Development Basics    What is a website?
 What is an IP address?
 What does HTTP mean?
 What is coding?
 What does front-end mean?
 What does back-end mean?
 What is a CMS?
 What is cybersecurity?
     1.
What is a website?
 Websites are files stored on servers, which are computers that host (fancy term for “store files for”) websites.
These servers are connected to a giant network called the Internet.
 Now, how do we access these websites?
This is where browsers come into play.
Browsers are computer programs that load websites via your Internet connection, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, while the computers used to access these websites are known as “clients”.
 2.
What is an IP address?
 I was always fascinated by how the Internet knows where to send data.
The answer lies in understanding IP addresses.
To access a website, you need to know its Internet Protocol (IP) address .
An IP address is a unique string of numbers.
Each device has an IP address to distinguish itself from the billions of websites and devices connected via the Internet.
 The IP address for HubSpot is 104.16.249.5. You can find any website’s IP address by visiting a site like Site 24x7 or by using Command Prompt on Windows or Network Utility > Traceroute on MacBooks.
  To find your device’s IP address, you can also type “what’s my IP address” into your search browser.
 While you can access a website using its IP address, most Internet users prefer to use domain names or by going through search engines.
 3.
What does HTTP mean?
 HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is what connects our website request to the remote server that houses all website data.
It’s a set of rules (a protocol) that defines how messages should be sent over the Internet.
It allows us to jump between site pages and websites.
 If I type a website into my web browser or search for something through a search engine, HTTP provides a framework so that the client (computer) and server can speak the same language when they make requests and responses to each other over the Internet.
It’s essentially the translator between you and the Internet — it reads our website request, reads the code sent back from the server, and translates it for us in the form of a website.
 4.
What is coding?
 Coding refers to writing code for servers and applications using programming languages .
They’re called “languages” because they include vocabulary and grammatical rules for communicating with computers.
They also include special commands, abbreviations, and punctuation that can only be read by devices and programs.
 All software is written in at least one coding language, but languages vary based on platform, operating system, and style.
All languages fall into one of two categories: front-end and back-end.
 5.
What does front-end mean?
 Front-end (or client-side) is the side of a website or software that you see and interact with as an Internet user.
When website information is transferred from a server to a browser, front-end coding languages allow the website to function without having to continually “communicate” with the Internet.
 Front-end code allows users to interact with a website and play videos, expand or minimize images, highlight text, and more.
Web developers who work on front-end coding work on client-side development.
 6.
What does back-end mean?
 The back-end (or server-side) is the side that you don’t see when you use the Internet.
It’s the digital infrastructure, and to non-developers, it looks like a bunch of numbers, letters, and symbols.
 There are more back-end coding languages than front-end languages.
That’s because browsers — at the front-end — only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript , but a server — at the back-end — can be configured to understand pretty much any language.
 7.
What is a CMS?
 A content management system (CMS) is a web application or a series of programs used to create and manage web content.
(Note: CMS's aren’t the same as site builders, like Squarespace or Wix.)  See why thousands of customers use Content Hub to build an optimized website that integrates with their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing suite.
 While not required to build a website, using a CMS makes things easier.
It provides the building blocks (like plugins and add-ons) and lets you create the structure with your code.
CMS's are often used for ecommerce and blogging, but they’re useful for all types of websites.
 8.
What is cybersecurity?
 There are always malicious actors looking to find vulnerabilities in websites to expose private information, steal data, and crash servers.
Cybersecurity is the practice of securing data, networks, and computers from these threats.
 The methods used by hackers are constantly evolving, as are the security measures taken to defend against them.
Failing to understand how your site could be targeted could result in disaster.
 As a result, a basic understanding of cybersecurity best practices is critical for effective web development.
You should also carry out security audits on a consistent basis.

 Access now     Learn more              Types of Web Development    Front-end Development  Back-end Development  Full Stack Development  Website Development  Desktop Development  Mobile Development  Game Development  Embedded Development  Security Development      My journey into web development began in the vibrant world of front-end development, where I loved turning code into visually appealing, interactive web pages.
 Later, I dived into back-end development, uncovering the nuts and bolts that power a website.
Learning Python and Ruby, I gained a deeper appreciation for the seamless integration of front-end and back-end.
 Whether you’re looking to hire a web developer or become one, you should understand the different types of web development that developers can master.
 These different types of web development primarily refer to the different sectors of the profession in which web developers can work.
Some of these distinctions overlap, and web developers will often master multiple types of web development.
 1.
Front-end Development  Front-end developers work on the client- or user-facing side of websites, programs, and software — in other words, what users see.
They design and develop the visual aspects, including the layout, navigation, graphics, and other aesthetics.
 The main job of these developers is to build interfaces that help users reach their goals, which is why they also often have a hand in the user experience aspect of their projects.
 2.
Back-end Development  If the front-end is what users see, the back-end is what they don’t.
Back-end web developers work on the servers of websites, programs, and software to make sure everything works properly behind-the-scenes.
 These developers work with systems like servers, operating systems, APIs , and databases and manage the code for security, content, and site architecture .
They collaborate with front-end developers to bring their products to users.
 3.
Full Stack Development  Full stack developers work in both the front-end and back-end sides of a website.
They can create a website, application, or software program from start to finish.
“Stack” refers to the different technologies that handle different functionalities on the same website, like the server, interface, etc.
 Because full-stack developers require years in the field to build the necessary experience, this role is often sought after by companies looking to build or update their websites.
This developer's all-around knowledge helps them optimize performance, catch issues before they occur, and help team members understand different parts of a web service.
This comprehensive skill set is typically covered in a full stack developer course .
 4.
Website Development  Website developers can be front-end, back-end, or full-stack developers.
However, these professionals specialize in building websites, as opposed to mobile applications, desktop software, or video games.
 5.
Desktop Development  Desktop developers specialize in building software applications that run locally on your device, rather than over the Internet in the web browser.
Sometimes the skillset of these developers overlaps with that of web developers if an application can run both online and off.
 6.
Mobile Development  Mobile developers build applications for mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets.
Mobile apps operate much differently than other websites and software programs, thus requiring a separate set of development skills and knowledge of specialized programming languages.
 7.
Game Development  Game developers specialize in writing code for video games, including console games (Xbox, PlayStation, etc.), PC games, and mobile games — which means this specialty overlaps somewhat with mobile development.
 8.
Embedded Development  Embedded developers work with all hardware that isn't a computer (or, at least, what most of us imagine as “computers,” with a keyboard and screen).
This includes electronic interfaces, consumer devices, IoT devices, real-time systems, and more.
 With a recent rise in interconnected devices as seen with smart appliances, Bluetooth technologies, and virtual assistants, embedded development is becoming an in-demand practice.
 9.
Security Development  Security developers establish methods and procedures for the security of a software program or website.
These developers typically work as ethical hackers, trying to “break” websites to expose vulnerabilities without intending harm.
They also build systems that discover and eradicate security risks.
 Front-End Web Development Languages  As I've already discussed, front-end web development focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements of a site.
It involves designing and building the user-facing side — what you see, essentially, when you pull up a site in a web browser.
 In my perspective, front-end development is likely the “easiest” way to begin a career in web development.
That said, as with any other aspect of this field, it will have a learning curve.
 Here are some of the most popular front-end web development languages:  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)  HTML is likely the language you first thought of when it comes to web development, and with good reason:  HTML is the backbone of any web page.
It provides both semantic structure and defines the elements of a website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
Web developers use HTML to give content a proper layout before customizing it.
 Below is the HTML code for a basic Bootstrap button .
 See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)  If HTML is the backbone of a site, then CSS is the meat.
CSS is responsible for styling the visual appearance of a website.
It allows developers to customize colors, fonts, layouts, and other design elements.
With CSS, you can also create responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes.
 Here's a code snippet for customizing the jumbotron element in Bootstrap CSS .
 See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
   JavaScript  JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactive elements to web pages, such as dropdown menus, sliders, forms, and animations.
JavaScript is widely used for client-side scripting (that is, the script runs on the client’s browser, and not on the server that hosts the website).
JavaScript generally enhances the user experience by making websites more dynamic and engaging.
 Below is a JavaScript code snippet for automatically opening links in a new window in WordPress .
 See the Pen Untitled by HubSpot ( @hubspot ) on CodePen .
 jQuery  jQuery is a fast and lightweight JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML manipulation and event handling.
It provides a variety of functions and methods to select elements, create animations, and handle AJAX requests.
jQuery is compatible with all modern browsers and simplifies cross-browser development.
 React  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of an application.
React has gained significant adoption and is widely used for developing complex web applications with a responsive and interactive user interface.
 These languages play a crucial role in creating visually appealing, intuitive, and interactive websites.
Don’t underestimate them: A website may have the best back-end structure, but unless the UI is modern, interactive, and user-friendly, it won’t be as appealing to a visitor.
 Back-End Web Development Languages  While front-end developers focus on creating the user-facing elements of a website, back-end developers work behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly.
 As opposed to altering the user-facing side, from my experience, back-end development languages help programmers manipulate servers, databases, and software that power websites and apps.
That makes it a little harder than learning front-end development.
 Here are some of the most common back-end web development languages:    We're committed to your privacy.

 Access now     Learn more           Python  Python is a versatile and more beginner-friendly programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
 It offers a wide range of frameworks, such as Django and Flask, that simplify back-end development tasks like database management and handling HTTP requests.
Python's extensive libraries and frameworks make it a popular choice among back-end developers.
 PHP  PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language specifically designed for web development.
 PHP seamlessly integrates with HTML and provides powerful features for handling databases, generating dynamic content, and interacting with web servers.
Popular PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony enhance productivity and maintainability for complex web applications.
 Ruby  Ruby is a dynamic and object-oriented programming language that prioritizes simplicity and readability.
It is most commonly associated with the Ruby on Rails framework, which provides a structure for building robust and scalable web applications.
 Ruby's elegant syntax and extensive ecosystem make it a preferred choice for web development projects.
 Java  Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and scalability.
 It is commonly used for building enterprise-level web applications that require high performance and security.
Java frameworks like Spring and Hibernate offer tools for building complex back-end systems with ease.
 C#  C# (pronounced C-sharp) is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft.
It is primarily used for building Windows desktop applications and web services.
 With the rise of the .NET framework, C# has gained popularity as a back-end language for developing scalable and secure web applications.
 Node.js  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime (that is, the environment where your JavaScript code executes) built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, opening up opportunities for full-stack JavaScript development.
Node.js is highly scalable, efficient, and ideal for building real-time applications and APIs.  Remember, back-end developers need to have a solid understanding of databases, server management, and web security, in addition to their language proficiency.
 That’s why back-end development is generally a little harder than front-end development, but it’s still plenty learnable nonetheless.
  The Website Development Process  In my experience as a web developer, I remember tackling projects without a clear process in place.
It felt like trying to assemble a puzzle without having the picture on the box.
It wasn't until I started working on a complex ecommerce site that the importance of a structured approach really hit home.
The project demanded a mix of front-end and back-end development, each with its specific languages and frameworks.
 By establishing a clear process, breaking down tasks, and systematically approaching each phase, the project became manageable and even enjoyable.
Trust me, developing a robust process is not just helpful; it's essential.
 Here are some key steps I found most helpful in my website development process journey.
 1.
Form a plan.
 Before laying pen to paper or hands to keyboard, it's vital to first connect with teams and personnel across your organization to develop a plan for your website.
 Here are some questions to consider before your first site draft:   What is the goal of your website?
 Who is your audience, and what do you want them to do on your website?
 What type of website are you building?
(e.g. basic informational, membership, online store)  What content are you aiming to publish, and at what volume?
 What’s the purpose of this content?
 How will you structure your website for the best navigational experience?
 What’s your budget?
  Answering the questions requires interfacing with your web development, marketing, and financial teams to determine your priorities and make informed decisions.
 Put simply?
It’s much easier to create a roadmap at the beginning of the process than reverting your progress at a roadblock.
 2.
Create a wireframe.
 All good websites start with a blueprint.
Developers call this a wireframe .
It doesn’t have to be an official document; it’s simply a vision for your site that’ll give both you and your developer(s) direction and a place to start.
You can draw it on a whiteboard or use a tool like Invision , Slickplan , or Mindnode .
 Wireframes are strictly visual tools that will help you understand where text and images will go on individual web pages.
You can use blank boxes and “ dummy text ” to get an idea of how your content will show up on the front-end.
If you're working with a company or freelancer, I'd recommend creating a wireframe so you have an idea of what your final product will be.

Draft up a sitemap.
 Next, it’s time to create a sitemap (not to be confused with sitemap.XML , which is an XML file that helps search engines crawl and find your site).
Just like a business plan gives a potential investor insight into your goals and deliverables, a sitemap gives a developer the information needed to meet your vision.
You can create your sitemap on your own or work with your developer(s).
 Here are a few questions to ask yourself when planning your site:   What individual pages do you want?
 What content will be on those pages?
 How can you organize those pages into categories?
 What is the hierarchy of pages on your site?
 How will the pages link together?
 What pages and categories are essential to your site and user experience?
 Which pages or categories could be removed or combined?
  Again, it’s a good idea to consult with other teams within your organization.
If you have an SEO and/or content strategy team, their input will be critical in the linking structure and categorizing of your pages.
 4.
Build the back-end of your website.
 Writing code might be one of the more complicated parts of web development, but it’s hardly the only component.
You also have to build your back-end and front-end site structures and design.
 Let’s start with the back-end.
 The back-end handles the data that enables the functionality on the front-end.
For example, Facebook's back-end stores my photos, so that the front-end can then allow others to look at them.
It’s made up of two key components:   Databases are responsible for storing, organizing, and processing data so that it’s retrievable by server requests.
 Servers are the hardware and software that make up your computer.
Servers are responsible for sending, processing, and receiving data requests.
They’re the intermediary between the database and the client/browser.
The browser will, in effect, tell the server "I need this information", and the server will know how to get that information from the database and send it to the client.
  These components work together to build the foundation for each website.
 As for building your website, backend developers will establish three things.
  Your logic code , which is a set of rules for how your website will respond to certain requests and how objects of your website will interact.
 Your database management , which is how your website will organize, manage, and retrieve its data.
 Your infrastructure, which is how your site will be hosted.
Hosting your own site will give you greater control, but it’s much more expensive and requires you to maintain your own server health and security.
  With these components and decisions in place, your website will be ready for front-end development.
 Note : The back-end is slightly tangential to web development because you don't always need a back-end if you're not storing any data.
“Data” in this context means any user-entered information that you need to save and persist.
Think about logging in to a website.
If they don't have a back-end, how could they remember your login information?
Or what your profile settings are?
To get this information, you need a back-end.
 Facebook, as an example, needs to know what people are in your Friends list, what events you have joined, what posts you have created, and more.
This is all "data" that lives in a database.
If they didn't have a back-end with a database, none of that data would be accessible to them.
 On the other hand, a website that’s purely informational and doesn’t require the users to enter any data wouldn’t need a back-end.
 So, if you have no data, you don’t necessarily require back-end development.
But that’s not saying you shouldn’t learn the basics.
You never know when you might need it.

Build the front-end of your website.
 If you’ve ever dabbled in web design or toyed with a website in WordPress, Squarespace, or Google Sites , you’ve touched front-end web development.
 The front-end stuff is important — it’s what your visitors, customers, and users see and how they’ll use your website.
 Front-end (or client-side) development includes a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It also controls components such as typography and fonts , navigation, positioning, and browser compatibility and responsiveness.
This part will reflect more of your initial site vision and what you included in your wireframe.
 As technology and consumer preferences change, client-side coding tends to become outdated much faster than back-end development.
This is where coding resources (like the ones we’ve included below) come in handy.
 6.
(Optional) Work with a CMS.
 Why would someone choose a CMS over coding “by hand” or “from scratch?” It’s true that a CMS is less flexible and, therefore, gives you less control over your front-end.
However, a CMS is easier to use (you have to write less code), and it often has tools for hosting the site , creating your website , storing user information, creating a blog , publishing landing pages, capturing leads, and even building an email list.
As a result, you’ll be able to make your website more profitable with less than half the work.
 See why thousands of customers use HubSpot's CMS to build an optimized website that integrates with their HubSpot CRM data and full marketing stack.
 CMS options often include plugins that remove the need to write a back-end.
For example, there are WordPress plugins for ecommerce so that, instead of building a complicated back-end to charge customers’ credit cards, you can just use an existing plugin and avoid the need to deal with databases and server-side code.
 Popular content management systems include HubSpot , Joomla, Magento, and WordPress — which has over 65% market share .
(In this case, we’re talking about open source WordPress software , not the WordPress site builder .)  7.
Acquire a domain name.
 At this point, your website will have an IP address.
It also needs a domain name , a memorable website name that your visitors can use to find your site.
 Perhaps you’ve heard of sites like GoDaddy and Hover .
These services help you purchase a domain name and register with ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
Most domain registrations are good for a year before you’re required to renew.
 Website builders and hosting services, like WordPress and Squarespace , also allow you to purchase a domain name.
 8.
Launch your site.
 Once you’ve set up a domain name and linked it to your host, you’re almost ready to unveil your work to the web.
 But not so fast — there are still a handful of things you’ll need to check before an official launch .
These include planning out responsibilities on your team, testing your site thoroughly for any glitches, optimizing for SEO , and a final check before “flipping the switch” and making your site live.
  Website Development Resources  One thing I've learned is that continuous learning is key.
When I hit a roadblock on a tricky coding problem, I discovered the wealth of online resources available.
Outside of connecting and networking with other developers, there are plenty of resources you can tap into to further your understanding of web development.
 Web Development Courses and Classes  Whether you want to explore back-end, front-end, or full-stack coding, here are a few online courses and classes that I recommend along with many HubSpot developers.

 Stack Overflow  Stack Overflow was introduced nearly 15 years ago and has since become one of the most popular programming communities in the world.
According to co-founder Jeff Atwood, “[Stack Overflow] is by programmers, for programmers, with the ultimate intent of collectively increasing the sum total of good programming knowledge in the world.”  Stack Overflow is a great place to go with questions because most of the time, other developers have asked and answered the same ones.
The forums in Stack Overflow keep you connected to other developers while also keeping you informed.
 Mozilla Development Network  Mozilla Development Network (MDN) is known to be more thorough and accurate than other online resources.
It’s not as much a community as a comprehensive resource and library of documents for coding languages.
MDN is useful when learning how certain functions work and staying up-to-date on coding and development news.
 Reddit  Reddit is a forum-based community where developers of all levels gather to ask and answer questions.
It’s incredibly interactive and includes people from all over the world.
You can also join “subreddits” based on specific topics such as web design , JavaScript , or freelancing .
 Dive Into Web Development       Jumping into web development has been a turning point for me.
This field isn’t just about coding; it’s about reshaping the way we experience the digital world.
Honestly, if you’re not diving into web development, you’re missing out on shaping a huge part of our everyday lives.
 Here’s my take: whether you're boosting your business online or building the next big app, understanding web development is key.
The field is constantly evolving, and staying on top of it is not just necessary; it's exhilarating.

   A meeting scheduler is software that facilitates a group of individuals scheduling a meeting easily and quickly.
Rather than having back-and-forth conversations to find a time that works, a meeting scheduler is a link your team can send to one or more individuals, allowing them to see available times for the person or group they are trying to book with.
Meeting schedulers often integrate with both the scheduler and the invitee’s calendar, so the users don’t even need to leave the meeting scheduler window to see availability.

HubSpot notifies you when a prospect opens your email and clicks a link inside, so you can understand exactly who's engaging with your emails and what they’re interested in.
Then, as these interactions are saved in your HubSpot Smart CRM database, personalize your follow-up and build meaningful connections with your leads.
                                      Follow up when you’re top of mind.
 Reach out to your buyers when they're thinking of you and increase your odds of closing a deal.

If brands have a reputation for giving helpful information, their marketing emails are much more likely to be engaged with.

          What is the difference between a landing page and a web page?
   Web pages are typically evergreen pages that live on your website and do not contain time-sensitive offers.
Common web page types include your homepage and your "about us" page.
 Landing pages are usually designed as part of a lead generation campaign.
Instead of serving informational purposes, landing pages encourage users to fill out a lead form in exchange of a beneficial offer such as gated content, free consultations, and more.
In many cases, landing pages are only accessible through emails, ads, or links, and are not reachable via your website or organic search.

   The goal of most landing pages is to capture new leads by giving users beneficial offers in exchange for contact and company details that help funnel them closer to conversion.
        What kind of offers are used to drive conversions on landing pages?
   The types of offers that appeal to your targets will vary widely based on your line of business.

Create as many online personas as your campaign needs!          Frequently Asked Questions               User persona or buyer persona?
    While the buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer, the user persona is a representation of the user of your products.
A buyer persona can be a user, but that is not always the case.
In both personas, the profile is created based on market research and real data from your existing customers.
They can be designed in many ways.
Usually, they come in the form of a templated, 1-2 page document highlighting the various key details of the avatar’s motivations, goals, needs, wants, and concerns.
         How to create a buyer persona?
      Gather a mix of information about the kind of customer you want to target.
It’s best to use a mix of demographic, behavioral, and psychographic information.
To collect the data, you can use surveys, interviews, existing paid databases, or even your CRM.
The biggest priority, though, is to be specific.
 Learn about the particular needs and goals of the buyer, think authentically  Create personas by combining both types of information to create an accurate reflection of the user  Finally, map the persona profile onto your product, and highlight how you solve for the user   If you follow these steps, the persona you build will be both accurate and authentic.
Buyer persona templates have the potential to add essential structure to this process.
          Why is a buyer persona important?
    Buyer personas are important because they allow you to segment different types of customers your business wants to attract.
Understanding the different motivations, goals, and behaviors of your target has the potential to allow your marketing to make more of an impact and resonate better.
In return, you will gain better potential customer engagement and higher-quality leads.
         What is a persona generator?
    A persona generator is a tool that allows you to visualize key differences between groups within your target audience.
Persona creators make the process of assembling, designing, and sharing avatars much easier than designing them manually.
This is because they are templated, standardized, and built to focus on your targets.

           Create my invoice           Invoice FAQs            What is an Invoice?
    An invoice, or sales invoices, is a billing document issued by a seller to a customer.
 The document typically:   Details the contact and billing information  Quantifies an itemized list of goods or services sold  Provides a clear total for the purchase  Defines any discounts or specific payment terms  Contains a unique invoice number and date        What is an Invoice Number?
    An invoice number is a unique number that you assign to each new invoice you create.
These numbers are then used to organize and track each invoice you send.
 Your invoice numbers should be assigned in sequential order.
For example, your very first invoice might be “invoice no.
1,” followed by “invoice no.
2,” and so on.
Invoice numbers aren’t specific to one customer, so you should keep a running total across all of the invoices you send.
 That being said, some businesses choose to adapt their numbering system to meet their individual needs.
This might mean that you choose to incorporate the date into your invoice number for filing purposes, like this: 20172711-001.
      How to Make an Invoice      Include the word "Invoice."  Assign a unique invoice number and date.
 Provide your business name and contact information.
 List out the details of the product(s) or service(s) you provided -- include quantity, rates, hours, etc.
 Provide the name and contact information of the customer.
 Highlight the subtotal.
 Specify any payment details or a due date if necessary.
  While your invoice details will change slightly depending on whether you are providing a service or a product (e.g., billable hours and rate vs.
quantity and cost), the above guidelines serve as best practices for creating a professional invoice.
      How to Send an Invoice     When it comes to actually sending your invoice off to the customer, you have a couple of options:   Send the invoice electronically via email or website.
 Send the invoice via postal mail.
  When sending an invoice electronically, you may send it through email or directly from your accounting or invoicing software.
For many businesses, this is a preferred sending method, as it allows you to deliver invoices to a customer in real time.
Invoices that are sent electronically are often paid electronically -- or, less commonly, paid via mail.
 When sending an invoice by postal mail, make sure that you consider the time it will take for your invoice to arrive.
While this tends to be the slower of the two options, many businesses still send invoices via postal mail to meet the needs and demands of their specific audiences.
      What is the layout of an invoice     There are many different layout options for invoices, but the most important thing is to include all of the necessary information in a clear and concise manner.
The layout should also be easy to read and understand.
Some common elements that should be included in an invoice layout are the following:   Company name and contact information  Invoice number  Date  List of products or services purchased  Quantity  Unit price  Total amount due  Payment terms  Due date        How to fill out an invoice     When you are invoicing a client, it is important to include all of the relevant information so that they can easily make the payment.
Here is how to fill out an invoice:   Include your name and contact information.
This should include your full name, business name (if applicable), address, phone number, and email address.
 Include the client's name and contact information.
This should include their full name, business name (if applicable), address, phone number, and email address.
 Include the invoice date.
This is the date that you are sending the invoice to the client.
 Include the due date.
This is the date that the client needs to make the payment by.
 Include a description of the services rendered.
This should be a detailed description of the work that you did for the client.
 Include the cost of the services rendered.
This should be a breakdown of all charges associated with the work you did for the client, including any taxes or fees.
 Include any special instructions.
This is where you can include any additional information that the client needs to know in order to make the payment, such as if there is a minimum amount required or if there are discounts for early payment.
By following these simple instructions, you can ensure that your invoice includes all of the necessary information and that the client can easily make the payment.
If you need to fill out an invoice, HubSpot's Invoice Generator can make the process easy.
Simply enter in the necessary information and our free invoice maker will do the rest.
You can then download or print the completed invoice for your records.
       What's the Difference Between a Bill and an Invoice?
    The term “invoice” is often adopted in business environments to define a payment request for goods or services purchased by a specific customer.
Once the customer receives the invoice, they will typically refer to it as a bill that they now owe to the seller.
 That being said, it’s not uncommon for the two terms to be used interchangeably, as they both refer to an itemized statement of payment owed to a seller by a buyer.
      What are the Most Popular Types of Invoices?
     Standard Invoice  Shipping Invoice  Service Invoice  Pro-forma Invoice  Commercial Invoice  Recurring Invoice   The standard invoice is the most common invoice type.
The standard invoice includes all of the basic information needed to complete an invoice, including contact information for the buyer and seller, an invoice number, an invoice date, itemized purchases, and a clearly defined subtotal.
 The shipping invoice serves as a formal payment agreement for goods sold between a seller and a customer.
For shipping invoices, information typically includes the cost and number of each item, the subtotal after shipping fees and taxes, the contact information of both parties, as well as an invoice date and number.
 The service invoice is often used by service businesses that bill customers based on hourly rates for services such as consultants, graphic designers, website developers, lawyers, auto repair technicians, and so on.
On service invoices, the subtotal is a reflection of the billable hours invested.
 The pro-forma invoice can be best compared to a quote or estimation.
The pro-forma invoice type is often used as a first step in negotiating a payment agreement and is not considered a true invoice, as it does not demand payment.
 The commercial invoice is used for customs in instances where goods are being exported across international borders.
The commercial invoice contains many of the elements of a standard invoice, in addition to the manufacturing country of the goods, what the items are being used for, the Harmonized System codes (if known), the number of packages and their total weight, and the reason for export.
 The recurring invoice typically contains a fixed price and is sent on a monthly basis for rented goods or services such as an apartment, business software, cell phone bills, and so on.
Recurring invoices will continue to be sent until the customer's contract or subscription expires.
      Where Can I Find Sample Invoices for Inspiration?
    While creating an invoice might not sound like a big branding opportunity, having a well-designed, professional invoice can make a big difference in the eye’s of your customer -- and help you get paid on time.
 Before making any type of payment, customers want to ensure that they are doing business with a credible, trustworthy company.
This means your invoices should be error-free with consistent branding and a clear, itemized list of goods or services.
 If you need help organizing all of the must-have information that comes on an invoice, download the free invoice templates above.
      Can you create invoices for free?
    If you need to create an invoice but don't have the time or money to invest in specialized software, you can use HubSpot's free online invoicing generator.
This tool lets you quickly and easily create professional-looking invoices that can be customized to fit your business' needs.
Plus, it's completely free to use!       Can I just write an invoice?
    Yes, invoices can be handwritten indeed.
Depending on your needs and preferences, there are several ways to write an invoice.
If you have a technical background or understand basic accounting principles, writing an invoice yourself may be a viable option.
If you would rather not go through the process of creating one yourself or using software, you can always find an accountant who is experienced in writing invoices.
 Writing an invoice yourself can be a risky proposition if you do not have the appropriate background in accounting.
Even if you are experienced with invoicing, mistakes can occur if the invoice is not properly formatted or contains incorrect information.
Additionally, there may be legal issues that arise if the invoice you write does not comply with local regulations.
It is important to ensure that any invoice you write is compliant with applicable regulations and laws so as to avoid potential penalties or fines from local authorities.
      What makes an invoice legal?
    An invoice is a legal document and must include certain key information in order to be considered legal.
Generally, invoices should include the customer’s name, address and contact details; an invoice number; a description of the goods and/or services sold; the quantity of each item; the total amount due indicated in both numerical and written form; any applicable tax rates applied to the sale; and the date the invoice was issued.
Depending on the jurisdiction, additional information such as terms of payment or a unique customer identifier may also be required for an invoice to be considered legal.
      Can I issue an invoice without VAT?
    In certain circumstances, it is possible to issue an invoice without VAT.
This would generally be the case where the goods or services being invoiced are exempt from VAT, such as educational services or food products in some countries.
Additionally, businesses which have an annual turnover below a certain threshold (which varies by country) may not be required to charge VAT on their invoices.
It is important to check local laws and regulations when issuing an invoice so as to ensure that you are compliant with local tax requirements.
      Can I create my own invoice template?
    Yes, you can create your own invoice template.
When creating an invoice, it is important to make sure that key information such as customer information, item and service descriptions, quantity, amount due and payment terms are included.
Additionally, the language of the invoice should be clear and concise so as to avoid confusion.
Our own free invoice template tool can help you with this.
 Depending on local law and regulations, you may need to include additional information for the invoice to be considered legal.
      How do I write a letter requesting an invoice?
    When writing a letter to request an invoice, it is important to clearly state the purpose of the letter in the opening sentence.
You should then provide further details regarding the invoice requested such as any relevant account numbers, dates and quantities.
Once you have provided all of the necessary information for your request, you should sign off with a formal closing line such as “Sincerely” or “Regards” followed by your name and contact information.

        Frequently Asked Questions               Why do the packages “start” at $15/$400?
    A solutions provider must have any Starter, Professional, or Enterprise level of HubSpot software.
Starter levels of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub currently list for $15/month, so that is the current starting cost to become a solutions provider.
A solutions partner must have the Professional or Enterprise level of one or more HubSpot software products.
Because CMS  is currently $400/month, that is the lowest current starting cost to become a solutions partner.
Partner Onboarding (cost varies by region) is also required for all solutions partners.

    Hear HubSpot's leaders give a high-level overview of the end-to-end approach HubSpot takes to data security, privacy, and controls.
                     Crafted, not cobbled  When your tools are cobbled together without a solid foundation, each tool has a different standard for security or protocols for controlling data.
Too much data spread across systems leaves gaps and cracks.
 HubSpot is crafted, not cobbled.
 Our product team takes a forward-thinking approach to privacy and security with the “Mainsail”, a framework for building a secure, reliable, and consumer-grade product.
We don’t build anything new unless we are meeting the security and privacy standards we’ve laid out.
       Scale your company with software you can trust             Secure by design  The core tenets of HubSpot’s security program are to safeguard customer data and to maintain customer trust.
 HubSpot uses a defense-in-depth approach to implement layers of security throughout our organization.
We’re passionate about defining new security controls and continuously refining our existing ones.
 Our security program is driven not only by compliance and regulatory requirements, but also by industry best practices like the OWASP Top 10 and the CIS Critical Security Controls and threat intelligence.
        Privacy and protections  Whether you’re using HubSpot products that are free or paid, feature-rich or lightweight, HubSpot works hard to maintain the privacy of data you entrust with us.
 Data you store in HubSpot products is yours -- we put our security program in place to protect it, and use it only as permitted in our Customer Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

     How does HubSpot encrypt data?
   All sensitive interactions with the HubSpot products (e.g., API calls, login, authenticated sessions to the customer's portal, etc.) are encrypted in-transit with TLS 1.2, or 1.3 and 2,048 bit keys or better.
Transport layer security (TLS) is also available by default for customers who host their websites on the HubSpot platform.
 HubSpot leverages several technologies to ensure stored data is encrypted at rest.
The physical and virtualized hard drives used by HubSpot product server instances as well as long-term storage solutions like AWS S3 use AES-256 encryption.
User passwords are hashed and are encrypted at rest.
Certain email features work by providing an additional level of both at-rest and in-transit encryption.
     Can we modify our own TLS settings?
   As of March 8 2021, the HubSpot app itself will no longer support TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. All of our officially supported web browsers support at least TLS 1.2. See our announcement here .
 This change does not affect CMS Hub website pages.
Websites hosted on CMS Hub can choose the TLS version to support.
We currently support the latest TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 cipher suites and encourage customers to use them.
Most browsers and SSL clients default to the most secure option automatically.
 Please review this knowledge base article for instructions on SSL and how to choose your TLS version within HubSpot.
     Can we configure our own Security Headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)?
   For instructions on domain security and security header settings, check out this knowledge base article .
     Can we perform a penetration test against our HubSpot application?
   You are permitted to penetration test the HubSpot products, as long as you adhere to these guidelines and submit any findings to our Bugcrowd program.
These guidelines are set so you can effectively test within the security controls we have in place.
Submitting into our Bugcrowd program submits directly into our vulnerability management program.
 Our Acceptable Use Policy requires that if you perform a penetration test, you must do so in an authorized manner.
Testing the app within the guidelines we set forth on is what constitutes authorized testing.
We recommend using a different IP address for scanning than you use to login to your portal.
This mitigates any risk that you may be unable to use your HubSpot portal due to blocks incurred by your tests.
       How do I set up Single Sign On (SSO) and Two Factor Authentication (2FA)?
   The HubSpot products allow users to login to their HubSpot accounts using built-in HubSpot login, “Sign in with Google” login, or Single Sign On (SSO).
The built-in login enforces a uniform password policy which requires a minimum of 8 characters and a combination of lower and upper case letters, special characters, whitespace, and numbers.
People who use HubSpot’s built-in login cannot change the default password policy.
 The “Sign in with Google” feature is available to all HubSpot customers.
More advanced SAML-based SSO integrated with any SAML-based IDP is available with any hub at the enterprise tier level.
 Customers who use an SSO provider can set up SSO-based login for their users.
Instructions for setting up SSO are available on this knowledge base article and HubSpot Academy .
Single Sign On and Google login users can configure a password policy in their SSO provider or with their Google accounts.
 Customers who use HubSpot’s built-in login are also encouraged to set up two-factor authentication for their HubSpot accounts, and portal administrators can configure their HubSpot portals to ensure that all users have two-factor authentication enabled.
     How do I control & restrict access to the HubSpot application?
   The HubSpot products enforce finely-grained authorization rules for customers.
Customers are empowered to create and manage users of their portals and assign the privileges that are appropriate for those users.
Please see this knowledge base article for more information about user roles within the HubSpot products.
     How can I go about performing my own backups of my data?
   While HubSpot backs up data on our servers for you, this knowledge base article will tell you how to export your content and data if you’d like to back it up on your own.
     What third-party vendors will have access to my data?
   Please see the Sub-Processors section in our HubSpot Data Processing Agreement .
     What is HubSpot’s cookie policy?
   You can read all about HubSpot’s cookie policy here .
     How do you evaluate the security of the apps in HubSpot’s App Marketplace?
   You can learn all about HubSpot’s App Marketplace certification requirements here , many of which directly relate to security.
     How are my integrations with email protected?
   As a CRM user, you have the ability to connect your Gmail, Office365, or IMAP-enabled email inbox.
 Gmail and Office365 integrations are authorized by and protected by the native integration capabilities in those platforms.
IMAP integration allows your connected inbox to synchronize mail into your CRM from other mail services.
When a user sets up an IMAP integration, the HubSpot products act as an IMAP client.
The services that support IMAP integrations have many built-in protections: data is encrypted in transit from end-to-end; the data is encrypted at rest at the field level as well as at the database level; and access controls ensure only authorized access to the data.
           Powerful software to grow your business—no matter the size.
 Your business runs on trust, that’s why it runs on HubSpot.
