       "The process is fairly simple; the main difficulties often lie in small mistakes - if you slip up while word processing your reader may pick up your typos, but the page will still be legible.\n",
       "However, if your HTML is inaccurate the page may not appear - writing web pages is, at the least, very good practice for proof reading!  Learning HTML will enable you to:  create your own simple pages read and appreciate pages created by others develop an understanding of the creative and literary implications of web-texts have the confidence to branch out into more complex web design  A HTML web page is made up of tags.\n",
       "Tags are placed in brackets like this < tag > .\n",
       "A tag tells the browser how to display information.\n",
       "Most tags need to be opened < tag > and closed < /tag >.\n",
       "To make a simple web page you need to know only four tags:  < HTML > tells the browser your page is written in HTML format < HEAD > this is a kind of preface of vital information that doesn't appear on the screen.\n",
       "< TITLE >Write the title of the web page here - this is the information that viewers see on the upper bar of their screen.\n",

       "Call it somethingdifferent.html and place it in the same WEBPAGES folder as detailed above.\n",
       "start formatting in lesson two  back to wws index         Fi rst S teps in For ma tting   The formatting of words has always been an integral part of the writing/ reading process: think about hand-written medieval manuscripts with their beautiful illuminated texts, or consider the design of the inside pages of contemporary novels or, indeed, of your essays and dissertations (page size, title page, contents, bibliography, font size, punctuation ...).\n",
       "We have become so familiar with certain print conventions that the medium has become largely transparent or, when it does assert itself we tend to 'feel' it as a sensual artifact (\"I like taking books to bed\").\n",
       " A new medium such as the web demands self-conscious attention to the format of its text, and millions of words (print and online) are dedicated to the topic of 'web design'.\n",
       " More precisely, within the genre of web-specific fiction, formatting techniques are used to generate literary/ artistic meaning, and explicit attention to formatting is the first characteristic of web writing.\n",
       "   This lesson will teach you simple formatting: how to change the colo(u)r of the font and background, how to apply font emphasis such as bold or italic, how to change the size of your font, and how to position text on the page.\n",
       "  BODY COLO(U)R  To change the body colo(u)r you need to add the attribute to the    < BODY > tag, like this: < BODY BGCOLOR=\"black\" >   FONT ATTRIBUTES   You can specify the font colour by using the BODY tag: < BODY BGCOLOR=\"black\" TEXT=\"green\" > Or you can stipulate the attributes of different chunks of text throughout the body of the page.\n",
       "This involves a new tag, the < FONT > tag and its partner < /FONT>.\n",
       "You type the font tag at the beginning and end of your text to change features such as colour and size.\n",
       "For example: < FONT COLOR=\"red\" SIZE=\"4\"> This is quite bold and bright < /FONT > You can use numbers 1-7 inclusive.\n",
       " < B > bold < /B>  < I > italic < /I >  < U > underline < /U >  < H > Heading tags can be used from a large < H1>  down to a very small font < H6 >, and tags must always be closed.\n",
       "For example: < H1 > BIG HEADING < /H1 > Try the out the other sizes, and note the space above and below the typed line.\n",
       "   POSITIONING TEXT  < BR > This forces a line break.\n",
       "< BR > This tag doesn't need to be closed.\n",
       "< P > Starts a paragraph.\n",
       "Close like so: < /P >  < P > Then repeat to start the next paragraph, and pay attention to the line spacing that results from this technique.\n",
       "< /P >  < P>  Are you getting the hang of this?\n",
       "It is quite a challenge to position text accurately with these basic techniques - not like word processing at all.\n",
       "Later on you can learn how to draw TABLES - a grid which enables the precise setting of web page elements - but, for now, see how much you can do with a few simple tricks.\n",
       "  < /P >  < CENTER > puts text in the centre of a page.\n",
